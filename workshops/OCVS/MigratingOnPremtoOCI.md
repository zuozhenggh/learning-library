## Introduction

In this lab, we will import the on-premises VMWare environment that we had exported in Lab 200 to OCVS. 

## Objectives
- Import an OVF file and access the environment as part of the Oracle Cloud VMWare Service.

## Required Artifacts
- Access to the Object storage bucket used to store the exported workload from Lab 200.
- The deployed OCVS environment from Lab 100.

## Steps

### STEP 1: Import the osCommerce OVF into Oracle Cloud VMware Service

- Use the pre-authenticated request URL from Lab 200 to download the zipped ovf file.  Unzip to extract the 3 ovf files on your computer.

- Once the import OVF and deploy OVF tasks are complete, you can power on the VM, select the VM that you just imported and power it on by clicking on **Actions**, then selecting **Power On** under the Power sub-menu. Again, the status of the operation can be monitored from the **Recent Tasks** tab.
