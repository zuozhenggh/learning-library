## **Step 0:** Running your Workload

### Login to OMS Console
Using SYSMAN credentials provided above, launch your browser and open a connection to [https://localhost:7803/em](https://localhost:7803/em). This assumes that you have successfully completed *Lab 2 - Setup SSH Tunnel*

You may see an error on the browser while accessing the Web Console - “*Your connection is not secure*”. Ignore and add the exception to proceed. Access this URL and ensure that you are able to access Enterprise Manager Web Console.

## **Step 1:** Inventory & Usage Details

### Overview

IT Manager wants to get an inventory of all existing databases managed by Enterprise Manager including different versions of databases, number of instances deployed over a period of time. This is to reduce number of different configuration sets and increase standardization across the data center.

All the items in this step are read-only, primary goal is to learn about inventory usage details within Enterprise Manager for all supported targets

### Execution

1.  Log into your Enterprise Manager as indicated in the Prerequisites step if not already done.

2.  From the Enterprise menu, select Configuration, then select Inventory and  Usage Details

  ![](images/0e4c2e20dec851fcdf23fd2e92bdee7a.png " ")

3.  In the ‘Show’ filter menu, select **Databases** to see all database instances managed by Enterprise Manager

  ![](images/cd409c11afa638eb7a1ab8f7cbc4f015.png " ")

4.  Analyze various database versions and number of instances for each version

5.  Explore pie chart to see the break-down of database inventory by color-code percentages. Also, in the **Graphical View**, choose **Trend** radio button to see the growth of given database instance over a period of time.

  ![](images/f79cd8ba7800098fa43363b5d4329323.png " ")

6.  In the Details table below, you will see details like

  - Database instance name
  - Host on which this database is located
  - Database type - cluster or single instance
  - Database version number
  - OS specific details like OS version, platform, etc.
  - Most importantly, LOB/Department information

Details table gives more information of each Database instance for you to get a good understanding of number of database targets deployed on a given host with OS version. If your organization uses properties like Lifecycle, Line of Business or Department, then you will be able to determine the number of targets deployed for a given business unit

Explore these features to get a good handle on Inventory and Usage Details

7.  Export inventory details to excel for reports. These inventory details can be exported to an excel file for offline analysis or sharing the report to management. With the excel report, you can filter based on the properties you are using to show department or line of business specific assets allocation and usage

  ![](images/c94cba301516e0ea135b3e9cb66e12cc.png " ")

## **Step 2:** One Time Database Comparison

### Overview

In this step, you will compare two database targets to determine configuration differences. One of the databases will act as reference target that aligns with your configuration policy. Your objective is to compare initialization parameters to ensure it is compliant with reference target

### Execution

1.  Log into your Enterprise Manager as **sysman** as indicated in the Prerequisites step if not already done.

2.  Navigate to ***Enterprise >> Configuration >> Comparison & Drift Management***

  ![](images/37238ad74bd47f814d428587fb1c6113.png " ")

3.  Review the different types of comparisons supported. Select “***Create  Comparison***” under One-Time Comparison to define one-time comparison

  ![](images/2f5e4a38007bb1c73d2910412d992b96.png " ")

4.  Choose the reference target that you want other targets to be compared with.

  ![](images/67ae37025024fc58b2294a0ab5e76191.png " ")

5.  Identify the reference target to compare other targets. To begin with, filter ‘Target Type’ to Database Instance

  ![](images/0b8231131420f895fa28a9eda5adb63c.png " ")

  ![](images/ca8b1d0f62b13c9d18bce9d9a2fbe41f.png " ")

6.  Select emrep.us.oracle.com as reference target

  ![](images/a9eb9557d92b44b49769db5703014f98.png " ")

7.  Choose Database Instance Template for Comparison Template

  ![](images/3ee284fe8bcfb393489d04a18e21719a.png " ")

8.  Provide a name for Comparison

  ![](images/684bb410e1d774de4eeb8e85f83992b2.png " ")

9.  Add targets to be compared

  ![](images/684bb410e1d774de4eeb8e85f83992b2.png " ")

10. Choose finance.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com target to compare with reference target

  ![](images/74b94658bae8dcf82b789f3913ff708f.png " ")

11. Click Submit. Comparison of the selected targets happens and below are the results

  ![](images/7d1ae7e5e1825760327a60ca6d5e47b0.png " ")

12. Filter configurations items to review only Initialization Parameters

  ![](images/a790e239f5134908f99d8d95102aa47c.png " ")

You can see the differences in the Initialization Parameters between the two targets.

Under the target compared column, you will see few icons. The icons that appear in the view are mostly intuitive:
- Equal sign means parameter properties are same across the reference and target compared
- Not equal sign indicates parameter properties are different across the reference and target compared
- A red box with 1 (left only) means that the comparison did not find a matching item to compare, this means 2nd target doesn’t have property configured to compare
- A red box 2 (right only) means that the comparison did not find a matching item to compare to the second configuration

13. Now, let’s go to Comparison and Drift Management dashboard page for further analysis of results

  ![](images/7b1f049a9f48cd24033a0695ef8b831f.png " ")

14. In the dashboard page, there are few tabs on the left side of the screen. One of the tab is a page for one-time comparison results

  ![](images/6fd24a9cc9f980bd16eef6d9819badbc.png " ")

15. Click on One-Time Comparison Results tab to review all corresponding comparison definitions

  ![](images/a96aeaccaa80489f6a038e8e80e14a56.png " ")

### Summary

In this step, you learned about continuous configuration drift monitoring of database targets against a reference target for initialization parameters using customized configuration monitoring template. This can be customized to align with your policies. By establishing a configuration drift definition, you can continuously monitor any configuration changes that can be potentially secure risk and remediate the drift immediately.

## **Step 4:** Database and Host Security Compliance

### Overview

Compliance Management provides the ability to evaluate the compliance of targets and systems as they relate to business best practices for configuration, security, and storage.

In this workshop, you will define and manage compliance framework, two different compliance standards, and corresponding compliance standard rules for managing security compliance of database and host targets.

Terminology Used in this Compliance specific workshop

#### Compliance Framework

A compliance framework is an organized list of control areas that need to be followed for a company to stay in compliance in their industry. Enterprise Manager uses compliance frameworks as a pyramid structure to map standards and rules to the control areas they affect. Compliance frameworks are hierarchical to allow for direct representation of these industry frameworks.

A single framework control area maps to one or more compliance standards. The outcome of these compliance standard evaluations results in a score for the given framework area.

#### Compliance Standard

A compliance standard is a collection of checks or rules that follow broadly accepted best practices. It is the Cloud Control representation of a compliance control that must be tested against some set of IT infrastructure to determine if the control is being followed. This ensures that IT infrastructure, applications, business services and processes are organized, configured, managed, and monitored properly. A compliance standard evaluation can provide information related to platform compatibility, known issues affecting other customers with similar configurations, security vulnerabilities, patch recommendations, and more. A compliance standard is also used to define where to perform real-time change monitoring.

A compliance standard is mapped to one or more compliance standard rules and is associated to one or more targets which should be evaluated.

#### Compliance Standard Rule

A compliance standard rule is a specific test to determine if a configuration data change affects compliance. A compliance standard rule is mapped to one or more compliance standards

35. Now, let’s create Compliance Framework to include the two standards you created so far. Objective here is to look at aggregated compliance score of both database and host at framework level. Go to Compliance Library page

  ![](images/e340f410d134688663c985c8f582bd27.png " ")

36. Go to Compliance Framework tab

  ![](images/e175c37661cf28b335e4bec317c461b2.png " ")

37. Create a new framework. Click Create, provide a unique name for the framework and author

  ![](images/3fa0c8b11aad2266faddbcdbb1f224e6.png " ")    

38. Click Continue. This will take you to a new page so that compliance standards can be added

  ![](images/7a91fe3c117e4011401f81ac8cc7a52e.png " ")

39. With right-mouse button on the framework name in the left panel, you will see a menu list for adding standards.

  ![](images/2468ca941d17cacc23d7bce5810d7e10.png " ")

40. Click Add Standard that will pop-up a window to select the standards to add

  ![](images/75775a99c565214542a8940d30819d11.png " ")

41. Filter the standards by choosing Database Instance in “Applicable To” menu. Choose the database compliance standard you created in the previous steps

  ![](images/25e1f78e471ea906fff67b5737cb28bc.png " ")

42. Repeat the above steps for adding

  ![](images/e1d1f0ee030f384e30b10220583113ad.png " ")

  ![](images/bbd99e3a29d171104127c80af5229114.png " ")

43. Now both database and host custom compliance standards have been added to the new custom compliance framework as shown below

  ![](images/744f3f8412ae9ac692fa878fdcf15fd6.png " ")

44. Click Save. A pop-up confirms the successful creation of custom framework

  ![](images/dbb1791108b4cf36102470ff53f04709.png " ")

45. Since two compliance standards are associated to this new framework, you can review the compliance results at framework level. Go to compliance results page

  ![](images/f697ca1790163653dea6ae04ba99b912.png " ")

46. In the results page, go to Compliance Framework tab to see the framework you created. You see an aggregated compliance score at framework level. This is an aggregation of both database and host standard you added to this framework.

  ![](images/914692ccab1d8d4a3aa636e937dd3989.png " ")

47. Click on the framework name to see details of the results. You can see the results at target level

  ![](images/86b6af426fcb18ba52d217f84ac99589.png " ")

48. You can also look at results at compliance standard level by choosing the standard tab. You will be able to see compliance score for each standard

  ![](images/4caed891e78778403a46b0dd6eff9d54.png " ")

49. You can also step into standard level score from the left panel as shown below for database standard

  ![](images/7ce67aa61ceb1570b24e1d1ee75d207b.png " ")

50. And below is the compliance score and details for the host standard

### Summary

With this step, you got a hands-on experience in creating a custom framework to monitor the security compliance of heterogeneous targets (Database and Host, this example). This will help you assess overall security compliance of all
Enterprise Manager managed targets from one aggregated view. And if required, you can drill down into each standard to assess details of target specific security compliance

This completes the Lab

Thank You!
