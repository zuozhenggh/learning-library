## **Step 0**: Running your lab
### Login to Host using SSH Key based authentication
Refer to *Lab 2* for detailed instructions relevant to your SSH client type (e.g. Putty on Windows or Native such as terminal on Mac OS):
  - Authentication OS User - “*opc*”
  - Authentication method - *SSH RSA Key*
  - Oracle EM and DB Software OS User – “*oracle*”. First login as “*opc*”, then sudo to “*oracle*”. E.g.
  ````
  <copy>sudo su - oracle</copy>
  ````

### Login to OMS Console
Log into your Enterprise Manager VM using the Public IP of your EM instance and the super-user credentials as indicated above”

You may see an error on the browser while accessing the Web Console - “*Your connection is not secure*”. Ignore and add the exception to proceed. Access this URL and ensure that you are able to access Enterprise Manager Web Console.

1. Update the Named Credentials with your SSH Key

Navigate to "***Setup menu >> Security>> Named Credential***" and Select ROOT credential; Click Edit. Replace the existing entry with your SSH Private Key and Click on Test and Save.

  ![](images/5429da7dcd00ecc7da6e779ed699c45e.jpg " ")

2. Fleet Maintenance Login to EMCLI

Upon login as user “oracle” via sudo from user “opc”, the following are performed automatically for your convenience:

  - OMS environment variables set
  - emcli session is established

While connected as “oracle” your emcli session may expire at some point due to inactivity. Should that occur login again as sysman

````
 <copy>emcli login -username=sysman -password=welcome1</copy>
````

**OR** Simply exit from terminal session as "oracle" and login again to reestablish a new session.

````
<copy>exit
sudo su - oracle</copy>
````

3. Steps Completed in Advance

In the interest of simplifying the setup and save time, the following steps were completed in advance and covered in this lab:

  - We have created and pre-patched an Oracle Home with 18.10 release using which will be use to create the gold image [/u01/app/oracle/product/18/db\_home\_src, Orasidb18c\_home1\_2020\_05\_13\_04\_10\_9\_emcc.marketplace.com\_3192]
  - We have created a pre-patched Oracle Home with 19.7 release using which we will create the gold image [/u01/app/oracle/product/19/db\_home\_src, Orasidb19c\_home1\_2020\_05\_13\_04\_24\_10\_emcc.marketplace.com\_2953]
  - Creation of the first version of “Tier\#1” Gold Image
  - Subscription of “finance.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com” Database to above image
  - Patching of “finance.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com” Database from 18.8 to 18.10 using Fleet Maintenance

We recommend that you read through each of the steps, review the emcli command, its verbs and deployment procedures to get an understanding of what it takes to do it from scratch. For a full end-to-end hands-on execution of “patching” lab, we highly recommend the *Automated Database Patching at Scale with Fleet Maintenance* Lab.

To ensure smooth execution of the intended use cases, we have pre-hosted the scripts to be used later at /home/oracle/fleet

## **Step 1:** Detect Configuration Pollution

This exercise enables us to analyze the database estate using Software Standardization.

### Software Standardization Advisor

Software Standardization Advisor enables administrators to understand various database configurations prevailing in their environment. Each deployment with a unique platform, release and patch level is identified as a distinct configuration. This provides the administrators a view of the configuration pollution in their estate. It also analyzes and provides a recommendation to standardize the environment and reduce the number of configurations required for managing the database estate.

  ![](images/em-fleet-maintenance-overview-2.png " ")

1.  Log on to Enterprise Manager Console as sysman

2.  Click on ***Targets >> Databases***.

  ![](images/038585c9308635261ae7e4aa956525af.png " ")

3.  In the Databases targets page, click on ***Administration >> Software Standardization Advisor***

  ![](images/6198ae4976d5ddad0fde0432c472e9e8.jpg " ")

4.  Software Standardization Advisor shows two graphs depicting current configuration and recommended configuration.

  ![](images/em-pollution-detection-1.png " ")

A Software Configuration is identified by Database Release, Platform and set of Patches installed on the target.

The Software Configuration Advisor run shows that there are 5 Unique Software Configurations in the environment as shown in the pie chart labelled as “Current Unique Software Configurations” and recommendation is to maintain 2 Software Configurations as shown in the pie chart labelled as “Recommended Software Configurations”.

Let us see details of the reports in next steps.

5.  Click on Generate Report.

6.  Click on Current Configurations to open the Excel report

  ![](images/em-pollution-detection-2.png " ")

When opening the downloaded Excel Spreadsheet report, a warning on XLS format and file extension mismatch may pop up (see below). Simply click on “Yes” to
ignore the warning and open the file.

  ![](images/d9ea997d07c30f80083e097f6b578200.png " ")

Current Configuration shows five different Oracle home software versions

  ![](images/84e0ac92b29e45e91b9d17a8e0b3a2da.jpg " ")

7.  Next, click on Recommended Configurations to open the Excel Report

  ![](images/em-pollution-detection-3.png " ")

The EM Recommended Configuration report recommends reducing 5 configurations and standardizing the database estate on 2 configurations, one based on 18c and the other based on 19c. This means All Oracle Homes of Release 18c should uptake the corresponding 18c configuration and the 19c homes will use the one based on Release 19c

  ![](images/06ff90fdba8aa5abebd066086e33f700.jpg " ")

Recommendation is based on union of all bugs included in the Patches in all OHs and based on configuration type.

### Summary
This completes Step 1. In this section, you learned how to perform the following:

  - Access the Database Software Standardization Advisor
  - View Configuration summary
  - Generate and download current and recommended configuration reports

In the next section we will follow these recommendations to perform the following using Enterprise Manager 13c Fleet Maintenance.

  - Patch database “finance.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com” from 18.8 to 18.10 [READ-ONLY– This step has already been implemented]
  - Upgrade “finance.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com” from 18.10 to 19.7

## **Step 2:** Oracle Database Upgrade with Fleet Maintenance

### Database Fleet Maintenance

Enterprise Manager Database Fleet Maintenance is a Gold Image Target subscription based out of place patching solution. Gold Image(s) are software library entities storing archive of an upgraded software home. Targets, to be upgraded, subscribe to a relevant Gold Image. Target subscription persists through the lifecycle of the Target or Gold Image unless modified by an administrator. We will go through the following steps for this Fleet Maintenance Exercise.

  ![](images/DB_Fleet_Upgrade.png " ")

### Upgrading with Fleet Maintenance

We will go through steps for upgrading database target ***finance.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com***, a Single Instance Database currently at 18.10.0.0.0 version that was previously patched from 18.8.0.0.0 using Fleet Maintenance. The goal is to upgrade this target to 19.7.0.0.0.

1.  Log on to Enterprise Manager Console and review the status and version of DB Target.

  ![](images/ec0b6926d4f65b52a771483ace24055c.png " ")

  ![](images/05ab9d53e622fe6b226647d67750c1dd.jpg " ")

You will see finance.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com. If target status is ‘DOWN’, start the target (using /home/oracle/start\_db\_finance.sh).

The next **[READ ONLY]** blocks are fully covered by the [Patching lab](../em_fleet_maintenance_patching/em_fleet_maintenance_patching.md) and are listed here for your information only.

#### Create Gold Image [READ-ONLY– This step has already been implemented]

2.  Review as prescribed

Gold Image represents a software end state. An Enterprise Manager Software Library Gold Image is a software archive created from a patched oracle home
uploaded to EM Software Library. Steps in this section are already implemented and are available here for review.

* Reference Home Setup

In order to create a Gold Image of the ‘recommended patch configuration’, you need to manually create such an Oracle Home as a pre-requisite step.

As the goal of this lab is to upgrade Database target from 18.10 to 19.7, a reference Oracle home fully patched to 18.10 [Orasidb18c\_home1\_2020\_05\_13\_04\_10\_9\_emcc.marketplace.com\_3192, /u01/app/oracle/product/18/db\_home\_src] was created and used to create the initial version of the Gold Image as further described in the next steps.

This reference Oracle Home is discovered in Enterprise Manager as shown below and will be used for Gold Image Creation.

Navigate to “***Targets >> All Targets***” and type in “Orasidb18c\_home1\_2020\_05\_13\_04\_10\_9\_emcc.marketplace.com\_3192” in the “Search Target Name” box.

  ![](images/ea2416958193764cc47426f0ad8a0a67.jpg " ")

* Review “Create New Gold Image” from ssh terminal using the following emcli command

````
<copy>cd fleet
cat create_image_Tier1_sidb_x64.sh</copy>
````
  ![](images/e4a3896e00184146230d4d974e64a528.png " ")

3.  List Available Gold Images

Execute the following commands in ssh terminal to see the list of Gold Images available for deployment, locate ‘Tier \#1 SI DB Linux64*’* in the emcli command output:

````
<copy>emcli db_software_maintenance -getImages</copy>
````

  ![](images/81fa9422f35c2dadac8595ef44a5f772.png " ")

IMAGE ID retrieved from the output of above command is used in further operations like Target Subscription. After retrieving a list of the available images, one can view a list of versions available for a specific image with the following command:

````
<copy>emcli db_software_maintenance -getVersions -image_id=A5F3D8523BDF635BE0531A00000AA55B</copy>
````

  ![](images/8c48a86f30874b71459424dc8f69e05f.png " ")

When a Gold Image is created for the first time, its first version is created as per the input and marked as current. Whenever we run a DEPLOY operation for a target, Gold Image version marked as CURRENT is used to deploy the new Oracle Home.

4.  Verify if Gold Image is Applicable

This step verifies if the image can be used to patch a specified database target. This is done by comparing the bug fixes available in the current Oracle home of the database target and the image. In effect this check is run to identify patch conflicts.

* Review and execute below emcli command:  
````
<copy>emcli db_software_maintenance -checkApplicability -image_id="A5F3D8523BDF635BE0531A00000AA55B" -target_list=finance.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com -target_type=oracle_database</copy>
````

  ![](images/a7ef76d93e9ee75da1a6a16a7f7620d4.png " ")

This command can show one of the following results:

  - **Applicable**: The image and database target contain the same set of bug fixes. The image can be applied on the specified target.
  - **Applicable and Image has more bug fixes**: The image contains more bug fixes than those applied on the database. The list of extra bugs is displayed. The image can be applied on the specified target.
  - **Not Applicable**: The database contains more bug fixes than those included in the image. The list of missing bugs is displayed. The administrator has to create a new version of the image that includes the missing bugs before the database can uptake the same.

#### Subscribe Database - [READ ONLY – This step has already been implemented]

5.  Review steps

* Run emcli command:

````
<copy>emcli db_software_maintenance -subscribeTarget -target_name=finance.subnet.vcn.oraclevcn.com -target_type=oracle_database -image_id="A5F3D8523BDF635BE0531A00000AA55B"</copy>
````

  ![](images/95439c2138aabd69382c9b0489f14c3b.png " ")

 Where:
    - target\_name – Name of the Database target which needs to be patched
    - target\_type – type of target to be patched. This should be oracle\_database in this case
    - image\_id – ID of the Gold Image to which the target should be patched

#### Create New Image Version

9.  Add Image version 19.7 to Gold Image Tier1 SIDB Linux-x64

* Reference Home Setup [READ-ONLY– This step has already been implemented]

Just as it was done for the first version of this image, a reference 19.7 Oracle Home is needed to create a new version of the image and was setup in advance. [/u01/app/oracle/product/19/db\_home\_src]. This reference Oracle Home is discovered in Enterprise Manager as shown below and will be used to create and new version of the Gold Image.

Navigate to “***Targets >> All Targets***” and type in “Orasidb19c\_home1\_2020\_05\_13\_04\_24\_10\_emcc.marketplace.com\_2953” in the “*Search Target Name*” box.
