# Predicting Flight Delays with Oracle Machine Learning & Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service

## Introduction

Welcome to **Predicting Flight Delays with Oracle Machine Learning & Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service** workshop. This workshop will walk you through the process of building flight delay prediction model enabling travel and transportation industry to supply reliable travel plans to passengers by predicting and preparing against unforeseeable delays caused by factors like weather, maintenance, or airport conditinos. 

Through this workshop, you will be able to know (1) how to build a a machine learning model predictint flight delays using Oracle Analytic Cloud (OAC) and Oracle Machine Learning Notebook (OML); (2) how that model can help optimize distribution systems by predicting delays in supply chains; and (3) how Oracle can operationalize and create an automated machine learning model in just days or weeks. 

To learn more about this workshop please watch the video below.

## Objectives
- Provision an Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) Instance
- Transfer Data to the ADW Instance
- Build and Apply Machine Learning Models in Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)
- Connect the OAC instance to the ADW instance to access the datasets
- Build Machine Learning models in OAC which is “no-code” development platform 
- Build and Apply Machine Learning Models in Oracle Machine Learning Tool (OML) which is built-in tool in ADW 
- Make Visualization using OAC 

## Required Artifacts
