## **STEP 0:** Running your Lab
### Login to Host using SSH Key based authentication
Refer to *Lab Environment Setup* for detailed instructions relevant to your SSH client type (e.g. Putty on Windows or Native such as terminal on Mac OS):
  - Authentication OS User - “*opc*”
  - Authentication method - *SSH RSA Key*
  - OS User – “*oracle*”.

1. First login as “*opc*” using your SSH Private Key

2. Then sudo to “*oracle*” user. E.g.

    ```
    <copy>sudo su - oracle</copy>
    ```
Follow the steps below to Start and Stop the different SecureOracle components.

## **STEP 1**: Start and Stop SecureOracle Components

1.  Login as “*oracle*” user and start the different components. E.g. start **Oracle Identity Manager, SOA Server and BI Publisher** by running the following command

    ```
    <copy>sc start oim_bip</copy>
    ```

    **Note:** the time to start the OIG components varies between 15-20 minutes.

    Additional commands are available to start or stop the different components and applications. E.g. use the following command syntax:

    ```
    <copy>
    sc <start|stop|status> oim          // start, stop or status OIG, SOA Server and OUD
    sc <start|stop|status> oim_bip      // start, stop or status OIG, SOA Server, OUD and BIP Server
    sc <start|stop|status> oam          // start, stop or status OAM, OUD and both OHS Servers
    sc <start|stop|status> oam_ohs1     // start, stop or status OAM, OUD and OHS Server 1
    sc <start|stop|status> oam_ohs2     // start, stop or status OAM, OUD and OHS Server 2
    sc <start|stop|status> all          // start, stop or status all OIG and OAM components
    </copy>
    ```

2. The **OIG Design Console** can be started from a remote machine or host computer using an X terminal tool like [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/ "MobaXterm") or [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) + [Xming X Server for Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/ "Xming X Server for Windows"). E.g start OIG Design Console by running the following commands:

    ```
    <copy>
    cd /home/oracle/products/oim/idm/designconsole
    ./xlclient.sh
    </copy>
    ```

3. The **Hedwig Mail Server** can be re-started if you experience issues when connecting with the Roundcube email client. E.g run the following commands to re-start the Hedwig Mail Server:

    ```
    <copy>
    cd /home/oracle/demo/hedwig-0.7/bin
    sudo -E ./run.sh stop
    sudo -E ./run.sh start
    </copy>
    ```

## **STEP 2**: Running Development Tools

1. The development tools in SecureOracle are aimed to support use cases like editing SOA composites for OIG workflow approvals but also to help in customizing and configuring the different components as needed. Login as “*oracle*” user using an X terminal utility like [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/ "MobaXterm") or [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) + [Xming X Server for Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/ "Xming X Server for Windows").

2. To star **Oracle JDeveloper with SOA extensions** run the following commands:

    ```
    <copy>
    cd ~
    ./startJDEVSOA.sh
    </copy>
    ```

    **Note**: you can find sample applications showcasing SOA composites with OIG workflows available under folder **/home/oracle/jdevhome**.

    ```
    NAME                                 DESCRIPTION
    RoleOwnerApproval.jws                Role single approval
    MultiRoleOwnerApproval.jws           Role multi-approval
    CustomDisconnectedProvisioning.jws   Disconnected app approval based on Sales Role
    ```

    Additionally you can find OIM out-of-the-box SOA composites in the following folder:

    ```
    /home/oracle/products/oam/idm/server/workflows/composites
    ```

3. To start **Oracle SQLDeveloper** run the following commands:

    ```
    <copy>
    cd ~
    ./startJDEVSOA.sh
    </copy>
    ```

    **Notes**: three connections: `HR`, `HEDWIG` and `IAMDB` are already defined to access My HR, Hedwig and IAM database schemas. Alternatively you can install SQL Developer in your local host computer to access the different database schemas.

4. To start **Apache Studio** and manage the OUD/LDAP instance run the following commands:

    ```
    <copy>
    cd ~
  	./startAStudio.sh
    </copy>
    ```

    **Note**: a connection `IAM-OUD` is already defined to access OUD.

5. To start **Oracle PL/SQL** command line tool pointing to the IAM database, run the following commands:

    ```
    <copy>
    cd ~
    . ./setDBenv.sh
    ./startPLSQL.sh
    </copy>
    ```

## **STEP 5**: Branding SecureOracle
1. Use the following instructions to customize the logo in the OIG Self Service interface.

    Copy using [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php "WinSCP") the image file (e.g. **.gif**, **.png** or **.jpg** file) you will like to use as logo in the Self Service interface.

    E.g. copy the image file to the following location:

    ```
    <copy>
    /home/oracle/products/oim/idm/server/apps/oim.ear/iam-consoles-faces.war/images
    </copy>
    ```

    **Note:** an image size of 145 x 38 pixels is recommended.

2. Login to the OIG Self Service console as user **xelsysadm**. Click on the **Sandboxes** link located in the top right corner of the Self Service page.

3. In the **Manage Sandboxes** tab, click on **Create Sandbox**, enter a name and click on **Save and Close** and then **OK**.

4. Click on the **Customize** link located in the top right corner of the current page.

5. The customization panel is displayed at the top of the page. Click on **Structure** and then click on the Oracle logo image, in the pop-up window **Confirm Shared Component Edit** click on **Edit** button.

6. Next, click in the **Gear and Pencil** icon located in the top of the right panel.

7. In the **Component Properties: commandImageLink** window, click the **Down Arrow** icon next to the Icon property, and select **Expression Builder**.

8. Enter the path image as follow.

    E.g. enter the path using the following format:

    ```
    <copy>
    /../oim/images/<my-custom-logo.png>
    </copy>
    ```

    **Note:** replace <my-custom-logo.png> with the file name of your image file.

9. Click **OK** to close the expression builder window, and then **OK** again to confirm the changes. The custom logo image should be displayed instead of the Oracle logo image.

10. Click in the **Close** button located in the top right corner to close the customization panel.

11. Go back to the **Manage Sandboxes** tab, select the sandbox name you created and click on **Publish Sandbox** and then click **Yes** to confirm.

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
