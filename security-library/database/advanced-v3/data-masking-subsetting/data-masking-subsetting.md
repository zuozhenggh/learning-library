## Task 1: Import Schema Structure

1. On the right web browser window on your remote desktop, open a new tab and browse to:

    ````
    <copy>https://dbsec-lab:7803/em</copy>
    ````

2. Login to Oracle Enterprise Manager 13c Console using the credentials below

    ````
    <copy>SYSMAN</copy>
    ````

    ````
    <copy>Oracle123</copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/dms-001.png " ")

   **Notes:** You may also access this page outside of the remote desktop by going to *`https://<DBSecLab-VM_@IP-Public>:7803/em`*

3. Navigate to the Application Data Models page from the Quality Management submenu by selecting the menu **Enterprise > Quality Management > Application Data Modeling** as follow:

    ![](./images/dms-002.png " ")

4. Briefly review the Secure **Test Data Management diagram** to familiarize yourself with the process

    ![](./images/dms-003.png " ")

5. Click [**Create**] to add a new ADM
    - Name the ADM: *`Employee_ADM`*
    - Click the spyglass for Source Database and select *`cdb_PDB1`*
    - Choose the option type *`Custom Application Suite`*
    - Checkbox the option *`Create One Application For Each Schema (default)`*

    ![](./images/dms-004.png " ")

    **Note**: Notice the options to create ADMs for Oracle Enterprise Business Suite (EBS) and Fusion Applications

6. Click [**Continue**]

7. Connect with the DMS Admin pre-defined user
    - Select the **Named** radio button
    - Choose the Credential Name *`DMS_ADMIN`* (pwd: "*`Oracle123`*")

    ![](./images/dms-005.png " ")

    - Click [**Login**]

    **Note**: Alternatively, `SYS` can be used as well... In a production environment, you could limit the privileges of `DMS_ADMIN` to only the packages necessary to perform their duties

8. Select the *`EMPLOYEESEARCH_DEV`* schema for the application data model

    ![](./images/dms-006.png " ")

9. Click [**Continue**]

10. Click [**Submit**] to schedule the job

    ![](./images/dms-007.png " ")

11. The job collect the ADM has been submitted

    ![](./images/dms-008.png " ")

    **Tips**: Right click on **View Job Details** link and select **Open Link in New Tab** to follow the process in another Web browser tab

12. Once the job completes, the `EMPLOYEE_ADM` will no longer be in a locked, uneditable status. Check the status by refreshing this page (**refresh icon**) and move forward when the Most Recent Jobs Status of the `Employee_ADM` has "**Succeeded**"!

## Task 2: Enhance the Meta-Model

1. Once you've created the ADM in Step 1, highlight the `Employee_ADM` Model and click the [**Edit**] button

    ![](./images/dms-009.png " ")

2. You may be asked for the database credentials. If so, select the **Named** radio button, choose the default credential using the `DMS_ADMIN` username and click [**Continue**]

    ![](./images/dms-010.png " ")

3. In the **Edit Application Data Model** screen, notice the applications for `EMPLOYEESEARCH_DEV` have been created based on the schema. Expand the entire list of tables associated with these applications (Menu **View** and Submenu **Expand All**)

    ![](./images/dms-011.png " ")

4. Now view the referential relationships captured in the ADM by clicking the tab **Referential Relationships**. Expand the entire list of applications (Menu **View** and Submenu **Expand All**) to examine the referential relationships under each application. Now that Cloud Control is aware of the foreign keys, it will automatically apply the same format masks to child tables

    ![](./images/dms-012.png " ")

5. **CAUTION: THIS PORTION IS FOR WORKBOOK REVIEW ONLY AND SHOW THE STEPS NEEDED TO MANUALLY ASSIGN A FOREIGN KEY. YOU DO NOT NEEED TO PERFORM THIS!**
    - If the database manages the referential relationships, the ADM will automatically capture these. However, if these are managed by the application, you will need to define these manually

    - If it is necessary to define a Referential Relationships, click the [**Add**] button provide the details. In your case, there is an additional table named `DEMO_HR_USERS` that is part of the `EMPLOYEESEARCH_DEV` application, but all of its constraints are enforced by the application and NOT in the database

    ![](./images/dms-013.png " ")

    - The `DEMO_HR_USERS` table uses **USERID**, but the relationship is not registered in the database as a foreign key constraint. Therefore, you must add a Dependent column on the `USERID` column

    ![](./images/dms-014.png " ")

    - Click [**OK**]

    - The new relation is available in the referential relationships view of your ADM, and now that Cloud Control is aware of the foreign keys, it will automatically apply the same format masks to child tables

    ![](./images/dms-015.png " ")

6. Click [**Save and Return**]

7. Now, your ADM is created!

## Task 3: Use Pre-Defined Sensitive Column Types

1. Navigate to the Application Data Models page from the Quality Management submenu by selecting the menu **Enterprise > Quality Management > Application Data Modeling** as follow:

    ![](./images/dms-002.png " ")

2. Look at the list of Sensitive column types. Click the menu **Actions** and select the sub-menu **Sensitive Column Types**

    ![](./images/dms-016.png " ")

3. Review the Sensitive Column Discovery Templates that are shipped by default with the Data Masking Pack.

    As an example, by hovering over the name **`EMAIL_ID`**, review this template to understand what this Sensitive Column Type will do when using it:
    - Search for '`EMAIL`' or '`MAIL`' in the Column Name
    - Search for '`EMAIL`' or '`MAIL`' in the Column Comment
    - Apply a regular expression pattern match to all of the Column Data if the user (i.e. `DMS_ADMIN`) has access to the data

    ![](./images/dms-017.png " ")

    **Note**:
        - This process uses Oracle Regular Expressions which is compatible with the IEEE Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) regular expression standard and to the Unicode Regular Expression Guidelines of the Unicode Consortium
        - In this case, the **Search Type** has been set as an **Or** condition, so if any of the conditions listed above are met, it will result in a match

## Task 4: Create a New Sensitive Column Type

1. Navigate to the sub-menu **Sensitive column types** as described in Step 3 previously and click [**Create...**] to add a custom Sensitive Column Type

    ![](./images/dms-018.png " ")

2. Create a Sensitive Column Type that will look for the wildcard "**NAME**" as part of the Column Name or the Column Comment:
    - Name: *`NAME`*
    - Description: *`Search for NAME in either the Column Name or in the Column Comment`*
    - Column Name: *`NAME`*
    - Column Comment: *`NAME`*

    ![](./images/dms-019.png " ")

    - Click [**OK**]
    - Here is the newly created Sensitive Column Type

    ![](./images/dms-020.png " ")

## Task 5: Create a New Sensitive Column Type using Pre-Defined Templates

1. Navigate to the sub-menu **Sensitive column types** as described in Step 3 previously and select the Sensitive Column Type template that you want to duplicate (here `EMAIL_ID`)

    ![](./images/dms-021.png " ")

2. Click [**Create Like...**]

3. Create the customized Sensitive Column Type "`EMAIL_ORA`" to identify the email from "oracle.com"
    - Name: *`EMAIL_ORA`*
    - Description: *`Search for EMAIL from Oracle Corp`*
    - Column Name: *`EMAIL.*;MAIL.*`*
    - Column Comment: *`EMAIL.*;MAIL.*`*
    - Column Data: *`^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@oracle[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$`*

    ![](./images/dms-022.png " ")

    - Click [**OK**]
    - Here is the newly created Sensitive Column Type

    ![](./images/dms-023.png " ")

## Task 6: Create a New Masking Format

1. To create a masking format in the format library, navigate to the Data Masking Formats page from the menu **Enterprise > Quality Management > Data Masking Formats Library** as follow:

    ![](./images/dms-024.png " ")

    **Note**: Alternatively if you are in Database Home page, select "**Data Masking Format Library**" from the schema menu

2. **Format library** appears with predefined formats that Oracle Enterprise Manager Provides

    ![](./images/dms-025.png " ")

3. Click [**Create**] to define a new use defined masking format

    ![](./images/dms-026.png " ")

4. Provide required information for the new format:
  - Name: *`Mask Oracle Corp EMail`*
  - Sensitive Colum Type: *`EMAIL_ORA`*
  - Description: *`Mask the Oracle Corp email by changing prefixe and domain name`*

    ![](./images/dms-027.png " ")

  - Add the formats entries types from the Add list, here:
      - Select **Random Strings** and click [**Go**]

    ![](./images/dms-028.png " ")

          - Mention the **start length** (here "*`6`*") and **end length** (here "*`8`*") in the Edit Format screen of Format Library

    ![](./images/dms-029.png " ")

          - Click [**OK**]

      - Select **Fixed String** and click [**Go**]

    ![](./images/dms-030.png " ")

          - Mention the string you want to add (here "*`@elcaro.com`*")

    ![](./images/dms-031.png " ")

          - Click [**OK**]

    **Note**:
    - When you will use this masking algorithm, it will replace the initial value by a new value generated from the concatenation of a random string of 6 to 8 characters at the beginning, followed by the fixed value `@elcaro.com`
    - At the bottom, you can see examples of the new values will be used

    ![](./images/dms-032.png " ")

  - Click [**OK**]
  - Here is the newly created Masking Format

    ![](./images/dms-033.png " ")

## Task 7: Manually Identify Sensitive Columns

1. Navigate to the Application Data Models page from the Quality Management submenu by selecting the menu **Enterprise > Quality Management > Application Data Modeling** as follow:

    ![](./images/dms-002.png " ")

2. Select the `Employee_ADM` Model and click [**Edit...**]

    ![](./images/dms-034.png " ")

3. You may be asked for the database credentials. If so, select the **Named** radio button, choose the default credential using the `DMS_ADMIN` username and click [**Continue**]

    ![](./images/dms-010.png " ")

4. Select the **Sensitive Columns** tab

    ![](./images/dms-036.png " ")

5. Currently, there are no sensitive columns discovered so you must initiate a search. Click the option to **Create Discovery Job...**

6. Provide the parameters for the sensitive columns discovery job. Choose the *`EMPLOYEESEARCH_DEV`* schema and choose the all of them **except `EMAIL_ID`, `ISBN_10`, `ISBN_13`, and `UNIVERSAL_PRODUCT_CODE`** Sensitive Column Types

    ![](./images/dms-037.png " ")

7. Click [**Continue**] to perform the search

8. And click [**Submit**] to run the job

    ![](./images/dms-038.png " ")

9. The job discover the Sensitive Data has been submitted

    ![](./images/dms-039.png " ")

    **Tips**: Right click on **View Job Details** link and select **Open Link in New Tab** to follow the process in another Web browser tab

10. Once the job completes, click [**Discover Results...**]

    ![](./images/dms-040.png " ")

11. Click "**View**" the "**Expand All**" to review the Sensitive Column Discovery Results

    ![](./images/dms-041.png " ")

12. Notice that the Sensitive Status of these columns is currently set to **Undefined** and now you have to set the sensitive status of all columns to **Sensitive** that you want to mask
    - Select each identified sensitive column entry that you want to mask (for this lab, select the *`DEMO_HR_SUPPLEMENATL_DATA.PAYMENT_ACCT_NO`*, *`DEMO_HR_EMPLOYEES.EMAIL`*, *`DEMO_HR_USERS.EMAIL`*, *`DEMO_HR_EMPLOYEES.FIRST_NAME`*, *`DEMO_HR_EMPLOYEES.LAST_NAME`* and *`DEMO_HR_SUPPLEMENATL_DATA.ROUTING_NUMBER`*)
    - Click [**Set Sensitive Status**] menu item
    - Then select "*`Sensitive`*"

    ![](./images/dms-042.png " ")

    **Note**: Upon successful completion, you should see all "`UNDEFINED`" labels toggle to "`SENSITIVE`"

13. Click [**OK**]

14. Here is the result expected:

    ![](./images/dms-043.png " ")

15. Click [**Save and Return**]

16. Your sensitive data are now identified!

## Task 8: Create Data Masking Definitions

1. Navigate to the Application Data Models page from the Quality Management submenu by selecting the menu **Enterprise > Quality Management > Data Masking Definitions** as follow:

    ![](./images/dms-044.png " ")

2. From the Data Masking Definitions Dialog, we will create a new definition. Click on the [**Create**] button to begin the process of masking data

3. From the **Create Masking Definition** screen, fill it as follow:
    - Name: *`EMPLOYEE_DATA_MASK`*
    - Application Data Model: *`Employee_ADM`*
    - Reference Database: *`cdb1_pdb1`*
    - Description: *`Mask Employee Sensitive Data`*

    ![](./images/dms-045.png " ")

4. Click [**Add**]

5. You may be asked for the database credentials. If so, select the **Named** radio button, choose the default credential using the `DMS_ADMIN` username and click [**Login**]

    ![](./images/dms-010.png " ")

6. Click [**Search**] to search for all of the identified and tagged "**Sensitive**" columns in Step 7 previously

    ![](./images/dms-047.png " ")

7. Tick the checkboxes to select all the columns

    ![](./images/dms-048.png " ")

8. Click [**Add**]

9. All the columns appear in the Masking Definition page

    ![](./images/dms-049.png " ")

10. The next step is to format columns by clicking the **Define Format** icon:

    ![](./images/dms-050.png " ")

    **Note** Colums that have this icon do not have a masking format defined

## Task 9: Format Columns Using the Format Library and Masking Primitive

1. In the Data Masking Definitions page definied previously in Step 8, select *`DEMO_HR_EMPLOYEES.EMAIL`*

2. Click on the **Define Format** icon:

    ![](./images/dms-050.png " ")

3.  As previously discussed, there are many different options to format the column of data to ensure the quality of the data masking

    ![](./images/dms-051.png " ")

4.  To use an existing format from the Format Library, click on the [**Import Format**] button

    ![](./images/dms-052.png " ")

5. In this particular example, we are going to select the Masking Format "*`Mask Oracle Corp Email`*" we've defined ourselves previously in Step 6

    ![](./images/dms-053.png " ")

6. Click [**Import**]

7. You can see the algorythmic sequence and click [**OK**]

    ![](./images/dms-054.png " ")

8. Once a format is defined, the **Define Format** icon disappears and it means you will be able modify the format later is you want

    ![](./images/dms-055.png " ")

9. Now, let's do it for another column: select *`DEMO_HR_EMPLOYEES.FIRSTNAME`* to define its masking format

10. Select **Shuffle** from the drop down list box

    ![](./images/dms-056.png " ")

11. Click [**Add**]

12. Click on the **Sample** icon to check the generated masked value

    ![](./images/dms-057.png " ")

    **Note** Here, we will take a random value from the same column

    ![](./images/dms-058.png " ")

13. Click [**OK**]

14. We’ll now use the same algorythm for the `LASTNAME` column but this one according to the `FIRSTNAME` column value in order to keep the consistence of the employee identity for the app. Of course in real life we won't do that, but here we only want to show you how to associate a masking value to another. Select *`DEMO_HR_EMPLOYEES.LASTNAME`* row and click on **Define Format** icon.

15. Select **Shuffle** from the drop down list box

    ![](./images/dms-056.png " ")

16. Click [**Add**]

17. Enter *`FIRSTNAME`* as value in the Grouping Columns and click on the **Sample** icon to check the generated masked value

    ![](./images/dms-059.png " ")

    **Note**: Here, we take the value of `LASTNAME` associated to the `FIRSTNAME` value which has been attributed randomly previoulsy

18. Click [**OK**]

19. We’ll now apply a format to the *`DEMO_HR_SUPPLEMENTAL_DATA.PAYMENT_ACCT_NO`* column. Select the row and click on the **Define Format** icon

20. In this example we are going to use one of the formats that Oracle provides - the **Generic Credit Card**. Click on the [**Import Format**] button

    ![](./images/dms-060.png " ")

21. Select the **Generic Credit Card Number** radio button

    ![](./images/dms-061.png " ")

22. Click [**Import**]

    ![](./images/dms-062a.png " ")

    **Note**: Here, this pre-defined library uses the Function `MGMT_DM_GEN_ANYC` of the Package `DBSNMP.DM_FMTLIB`

23. Click [**OK**]

    **Note:**
    - If the function and package names **are not in the correct fields** you will have an error!

    ![](./images/dms-062b.png " ")

    - Please, be sure you put Package Name `DBSNMP.DM_FMTLIB` and Function Name `MGMT_DM_GEN_ANYC`

    ![](./images/dms-062c.png " ")

    - Then, click [**OK**]

24. We’ll define a customised format to the *`DEMO_HR_SUPPLEMENTAL_DATA.ROUTING_NUMBER`* column as the format **999-999-999** where digits are randomly attributed. Select the row and click on the **Define Format** icon

25. Select **Random Digits** from the drop down list box

    ![](./images/dms-063.png " ")

26. Click [**Add**]

27. Enter "*`3`*" for **Start Length** and **End Length**

    ![](./images/dms-064.png " ")

28. Select **Fixed String** from the drop down list box

    ![](./images/dms-065.png " ")

29. Click [**Add**]

30. Enter "*`-`*" for value

    ![](./images/dms-066.png " ")

31. Select **Random Digits** from the drop down list box

    ![](./images/dms-063.png " ")

32. Click [**Add**]

33. Enter "*`3`*" for **Start Length** and **End Length**

    ![](./images/dms-067.png " ")

34. Select **Fixed String** from the drop down list box

    ![](./images/dms-065.png " ")

35. Click [**Add**]

36. Enter "*`-`*" for value

    ![](./images/dms-068.png " ")

37. Select **Random Digits** from the drop down list box

    ![](./images/dms-063.png " ")

38. Click [**Add**]

39. Enter "*`3`*" for **Start Length** and **End Length**

    ![](./images/dms-069.png " ")

40. Click on the **Sample** icon to check if the generated value conforms to the format you want

    ![](./images/dms-070.png " ")

41. Click [**OK**]

42. Finally, we’ll define a format to the *`DEMO_HR_USERS.EMAIL`* column. Select the row and click on the **Define Format** icon

43. Select **Array List** from the drop down list box

    ![](./images/dms-071.png " ")

44. Click [**Add**]

45. Enter "*`mask0,mask1,mask2,mask3`*" as **List of Values**

    ![](./images/dms-072.png " ")

46. Select **Fixed String** from the drop down list box

    ![](./images/dms-065.png " ")

47. Click [**Add**]

48. Enter "*`@`*" for value

    ![](./images/dms-073.png " ")

49. Select **Array List** from the drop down list box

    ![](./images/dms-071.png " ")

50. Click [**Add**]

51. Enter "*`mail.com,look.com,ux.net,boot.org`*" as **List of Values**

    ![](./images/dms-074.png " ")

52. Click on the **Sample** icon to check if the generated value conforms to the format you want

    ![](./images/dms-075.png " ")

53. Click [**OK**]

    ![](./images/dms-076.png " ")

54. Now click [**OK**] to complete the creation of a Masking Definition

    ![](./images/dms-077.png " ")

## Task 10: Generate Data Masking Scripts

1. Once you've defined all the data masking formats in Step 9, the status of your masking definition is "**Script Not Generated**"

    ![](./images/dms-078.png " ")

    **Note**: This status means that you have to generate now the script before executing the masking of your sensitive data

2. Select the masking definition *`EMPLOYEE_DATA_MASK`* and click on the [**Generate Script**] button

    ![](./images/dms-079.png " ")

    **Note**: Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 13c may route the submission as a submitted Job, in that event you will see a screen that looks like the one below. Submit the job with Named Credentials

3. At the Database Login screen, choose the **Named** credential for `DMS_ADMIN`

    ![](./images/dms-010.png " ")

4. Click [**Login**]

5. In the **Script Generation Options** section, tick the masking mode you want (here *Mask In-Database*):

    ![](./images/dms-080.png " ")

    **Note**:
    - **Mask In-Database** to replace sensitive directly inside the database. Usually, you will execute this script into a copy of the Production DB
    - **Mask In-Export** to generate from the source database an Oracle Data Pump file including the masked data. Usually, you will execute this script from Production DB

6. In the **Database Credentials** section, check the *`Named`* option and select *`DMS_ADMIN`* for Credential Name

    ![](./images/dms-081a.png " ")

7. In the **Start** section, make sure *`Immediately`* is ticked and click [**Submit**]

    ![](./images/dms-081b.png " ")

8. To view the status of your job, you can follow the prompts provided by Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 13c. Once the job has been successfully generated, navigate back to your Data Masking job, you are ready to submit it

    ![](./images/dms-082.png " ")

    **Tips**: You can refresh the screen by clicking [**Go**]

    ![](./images/dms-083.png " ")

9. Once generating the script, the status will change from "`Script Generation Job Scheduled`" to "**`Script Generated`**"

    ![](./images/dms-084.png " ")

10. You may be forwarded to the **Script Generation Results** page. There are a number of areas to explore and drill into. Make sure the radio button next to `EMPLOYEE_DATA_MASK` is selected. From **Actions** select **View Script** and click [**Go**]

    ![](./images/dms-085.png " ")

11. Have a look over the PL/SQL generated script

    ![](./images/dms-086.png " ")

    **Note**:
    - Oracle Data Masking Pack **performs a series of validation steps** to ensure that the data masking process proceeds to a successful completion without errors. One of the checks that it performs is **validating the masking formats**. This is a necessary step in the data masking process to ensure that the chosen masking formats meet the database and application integrity requirements
    - These requirements may include generating unique values for the column being masked because of uniqueness constraints or generating values that meet the column length or type requirements
    - Upon successful completion of the validation check, Oracle Data Masking Pack **generates the PL/SQL-based masking script that is transferred to the target database for execution**
    - Oracle Data Masking Pack uses a highly efficient and robust mechanism to create masked data
    - Oracle Data Masking Pack **performs bulk operations** to rapidly replace the table containing sensitive data with an identical table containing masked data while retaining the original database constraints, referential integrity and associated access structures, such as INDEXs and PARTITIONs, and access permissions, such as GRANTs
    - Unlike masking processes that are traditionally slow because they perform table updates, Oracle Data Masking Pack takes advantage of the built-in optimizations in the database to **disable database logging** and **execute in parallel** to quickly create a masked replacement for the original table
    - The original table containing sensitive data is dropped from the database completely and is no longer accessible

    **Tips**:
    - This script could be taken and executed on other targets which have exactly the same schema structure
    - You have the ability to save the script locally by clicking [**Save Script**]

    ![](./images/dms-087.png " ")

12. Click [**Return**] to return to the Data Masking Definitions screen

## Task 11: Execute the Data Masking Scripts

**Recommendation:** To execute the Data Masking script you will need an SSH key-pair. Do not use a putty key-pair, instead follow the instructions below to create an RSA key-pair.

### **Generate SSH Keys**

## Task 12: Compare the Pre-Masked Data vs. the Post-Masked Data

1. Once the job successfully completes, query the masked data in the Development and Production environments for a before and after comparison

2. Open **SQL Developer** on your PC and connect to **pdb1 as sysdba**

    ![](./images/dms-093.png " ")

3. Press [**Alt**]+[**F10**] to open a SQL Worksheet and select `pdb1@sysdba`

    ![](./images/dms-094.png " ")

4. Do it again in order to have 2 tabs

5. In the first one, copy the following queries for the **PROD: BEFORE MASKING**

    ````
    <copy>
    -- -----------------------------
    -- PROD: BEFORE MASKING
    -- -----------------------------

    -- EMPLOYEE_DATA
    SELECT distinct(e.userid), e.firstname, e.lastname, e.email, sd.routing_number, sd.payment_acct_no
      FROM EMPLOYEESEARCH_PROD.DEMO_HR_EMPLOYEES e, EMPLOYEESEARCH_PROD.DEMO_HR_SUPPLEMENTAL_DATA sd
     WHERE e.userid = sd.userid
     ORDER BY 1;

    -- USERS_DATA
    SELECT userid, email
      FROM EMPLOYEESEARCH_PROD.DEMO_HR_USERS
     ORDER BY 1;

    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/dms-097.png " ")

6. In the second one, copy the following queries for the **DEV: AFTER MASKING**

    ````
    <copy>
    -- -----------------------------
    -- DEV: AFTER MASKING
    -- -----------------------------

    -- EMPLOYEE_DATA
    SELECT distinct(e.userid), e.firstname, e.lastname, e.email, sd.routing_number, sd.payment_acct_no
      FROM EMPLOYEESEARCH_DEV.DEMO_HR_EMPLOYEES e, EMPLOYEESEARCH_DEV.DEMO_HR_SUPPLEMENTAL_DATA sd
     WHERE e.userid = sd.userid
     ORDER BY 1;

    -- USERS_DATA
    SELECT userid, email
      FROM EMPLOYEESEARCH_DEV.DEMO_HR_USERS
     ORDER BY 1;

    </copy>
    ````

    ![](./images/dms-098.png " ")

7. **Execute all these queries** and **compare the results** to confirm your sensitives data have been masked

    - Employee Data:
        - **Before masking** (in PROD)

    ![](./images/dms-099.png " ")

        - **After masking** (in DEV)

    ![](./images/dms-100.png " ")

    - Users Data:
        - **Before masking** (in PROD)

    ![](./images/dms-101.png " ")

        - **After masking** (in DEV)

    ![](./images/dms-102.png " ")

8. **Now, your sensitive data has been masked!**

## Task 13: Create Data Subsetting Definitions

1. Navigate to the Application Data Models page from the Quality Management submenu by selecting the menu **Enterprise > Quality Management > Data Subsetting Definitions** as follow:

    ![](./images/dms-130.png " ")

2. From the Data Subsetting Definitions Dialog, we will create a new definition. Click on the [**Create**] button to begin the process of masking data

3. From the **Data Subsetting Definition Properties** screen, fill it as follow:
    - Name: *`EMPLOYEE_DATA_SUBSET`*
    - Description: *`Subset Employee Data`*
    - Application Data Model: *`Employee_ADM`*
    - Source Database: *`cdb1_pdb1`*

    ![](./images/dms-131.png " ")

4. Click [**Continue**]

5. In the **Credentials"** section, select the **Named** radio button, choose the default credential using the `DMS_ADMIN` username

    ![](./images/dms-132.png " ")

6. Click [**Submit**]

7. Now your Subsetting definition is scheduling... please refresh the page until you see "**Succeeded**"

    ![](./images/dms-133.png " ")

8. Once the subsetting definition is created, select it and click on [**Edit...**]

    ![](./images/dms-134.png " ")

9. In the "**Applications**" tab, select the schema `EMPLOYEESEARCH_DEV(EMPLOYEESEARCH_DEV)` available in your ADM

    ![](./images/dms-135.png " ")

10. In the "**Object Rules**" tab, create all the Subset rules by clicking [**Create**] as many time as needed

    ![](./images/dms-136.png " ")

    Here, we will create 4 Object Rules, so in the "Create Object Rule" screen proceed like this...

    - ... for `DEMO_HR_EMPLOYEES` table, because this a dataset table, we will keep only **25% of rows**
        - In "Objects", select **Specified** and choose "*`DEMO_HR_EMPLOYEES`*"
        - In "Rows to Include", select **Some Rows** and put "*`25`*"
        - Tick "**Include Related Rows**" and select "**Ancestor and Descendant Objects**"

    ![](./images/dms-137.png " ")

        - Click [**OK**]

    - ... for `DEMO_HR_ERROR_LOG` table, because this is a log table we will keep **0% of rows**
        - In "Objects", select **Specified** and choose "*`DEMO_HR_ERROR_LOG`*"
        - In "Rows to Include", select **Rows Where** and put "*`1=0`*" (here this condition allow to extract 0 rows!)
        - Tick "**Include Related Rows**" and select "**Ancestor and Descendant Objects**"

    ![](./images/dms-138.png " ")

        - Click [**OK**]

    - ... for `DEMO_HR_ROLES` table, because this a reference table, we will keep **100% of rows**
        - In "Objects", select **Specified** and choose "*`DEMO_HR_ROLES`*"
        - In "Rows to Include", select **All Rows**
        - Tick "**Include Related Rows**" and select "**Ancestor and Descendant Objects**"

    ![](./images/dms-139.png " ")

        - Click [**OK**]

    - ... for `DEMO_HR_USERS` table, because this a reference table, we will keep **100% of rows**
        - In "Objects", select **Specified** and choose "*`DEMO_HR_USERS`*"
        - In "Rows to Include", select **All Rows**
        - Tick "**Include Related Rows**" and select "**Ancestor and Descendant Objects**"

    ![](./images/dms-140.png " ")

        - Click [**OK**]

    - Now, you should see all your Object Rules like this

    ![](./images/dms-141.png " ")

11. In the **Space Estimate** tab, expand the entire list (Menu **View** and Submenu **Expand All**)

    ![](./images/dms-142.png " ")

    **Note:**
    - Here, you can see a simulation of the effects of your subsetting scripts
    - The "Object Rule" column shows you the "Object Rules" defined previously
    - Like that you can see easily the direct impact on the subset size targeted (in MB and in number of rows)
    - Because the tables are dependant each other, you see the effect of your subsetting on the parent-child tables. As example, `DEMO_HR_EMPLOYEES` keep only 25% of rows, but because there's a dependance with `DEMO_HR_SUPLLEMENATL_DATA` table, this one is also impacted by the subsetting and it will keep only 71%.

12. You can stop here if you just want to subset your data, but we will continue by **associating the Data Masking scripts** generated previously in Step 11 to show that is possible to combine the subsetting and the masking in a same process

    - In the **Data Masking Definitions** tab, click [**Add**]

    ![](./images/dms-143.png " ")

    - Select the masking définition *`EMPLOYEE_DATA_MASK`* created earlier

    ![](./images/dms-144.png " ")

    - Click [**OK**]

    - Now, you Data Masking script is associated to you Data Subsetting definition and it will be executed after subsetting your data

    ![](./images/dms-145.png " ")

13. Click [**Return**]

## Task 14: Generate Data Subsetting Scripts

Once you've defined all the data subsetting definitions in Step 13, it's time to generate the Subsetting scripts

1. But before, we have to restore the `EMPLOYEESEARCH_DEV` tables on **pdb1** by cloning data from `EMPLOYEESEARCH_PROD` schema to have original data

    - Open a Terminal session on your **DBSec-Lab VM as *oracle* user**

    ````
    <copy>sudo su - oracle</copy>

    - In "Database Credentials", select the **Named** radio button and choose the default credential using the `DMS_ADMIN` username
    - In "Host Credentials", select the **Named** radio button and choose the default credential using the `OS_ORACLE_SSH` credential name

    ![](./images/dms-153.png " ")

    - Click [**Continue**]

5. In the "**Generate Subset: Parameters**" screen

    - In "Subset Directory", select "*`Select a custom directory path on target database to save subset scripts`*"
    - Enter this location: *`/home/oracle/DBSecLab/livelabs/dms`*
    - Tick the checkbox "*`The selected target is not a production database`*"

    ![](./images/dms-154.png " ")

    - Click [**Continue**]

6. A warning message tells you that a Directory will be created to store the scripts into the location you've mentioned

    ![](./images/dms-155.png " ")

## **Appendix**: About the Product
### **Overview**
Oracle Data Masking pack for Enterprise Manager, part of Oracle's comprehensive portfolio of database security solutions, helps organizations comply with data privacy and protection mandates such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the upcoming California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and numerous laws that restrict the use of actual customer data. With Oracle Data Masking, sensitive information such as credit card or social security numbers can be replaced with realistic values, allowing production data to be safely used for development, testing, or sharing with out-sourced or off-shore partners for other non-production purposes. Oracle Data Masking uses a library of templates and format rules, consistently transforming data in order to maintain referential integrity for applications.

Data masking (also known as data scrambling and data anonymization) is the process of replacing sensitive information copied from production databases to test or non-production databases with realistic, but scrubbed, data based on masking rules. Data masking is ideal for virtually any situation when confidential or regulated data needs to be shared with other non-production users; for instance, internal users such as application developers, or external business partners, like offshore testing companies or suppliers and customers. These non-production users need to access some of the original data, but do not need to see every column of every table, especially when the information is protected by government regulations.

Data masking allows organizations to generate realistic and fully functional data with similar characteristics as the original data to replace sensitive or confidential information. This contrasts with encryption or Virtual Private Database, which simply hide data, allowing the original data to be retrieved with the appropriate access or key. With data masking, the original sensitive data cannot be retrieved or accessed. Names, addresses, phone numbers, and credit card details are examples of data that require protection of the information content from inappropriate visibility. Live production database environments contain valuable and confidential data — access to this information is tightly controlled. However, each production system usually has replicated development copies, and the controls on such test environments are less stringent. This greatly increases the risks that the data might be used inappropriately. Data masking can modify sensitive database records so that they remain usable, but contain no confidential or personally identifiable information. Yet, the masked test data resembles the original in appearance to ensure the integrity of the application.

    ![](./images/dms-concept.png " ")

### **Why do I need Data Masking?**

There are several reasons why you would need it, based on challenges like the ones below
- Personally Identifiable and sensitive data is being shared with parties that do not have a business need-to-know in development and testing groups.
- The use of operational databases containing personal information or any other sensitive information is being used for testing purposes. All identified sensitive details and content should be removed or modified beyond recognition before use.
- There is no established, documented procedure and enforcement of data cleansing standards in masking and cleansing of sensitive production data before distribution to development and QA environments.
- The steps and process necessary to provide development and QA environments with properly masked data are very time consuming, manual and inconsistent.

### **Benefits of using DMS**
- Maximize the business value of data by masking sensitive information
- Minimize the compliance boundary by not proliferating the sensitive production information
- Lower the storage costs on test and development environments by subsetting data
- Automate the discovery of sensitive data and parent-child relationships
- Provide a comprehensive library of masking formats, masking transformations, subsetting techniques, and select application templates
- Mask and subset data in-Database or on-the-file by extracting the data from a source database
- Mask and subset both Oracle and non-Oracle databases
- Mask and subset Oracle Databases hosted on the Oracle cloud
- Preserve data integrity during masking and subsetting and offers many more unique features
- Integrate with select Oracle testing, security, and integration products.
