# Build, test and deploy applications on Oracle's Cloud! #
The Oracle Learning Library is a place to explore Oracle's products and services using labs designed to enhance your experience building and deploying applications on the Cloud and On-Premises.   This library of assets covers everything from how to provision the world's first autonomous database to setting up a webserver on our world class Generation 2 infrastructure, machine learning and much more.  Use your existing Oracle Cloud account or a Free Tier account to build, test, and deploy applications on Oracle's Cloud.
