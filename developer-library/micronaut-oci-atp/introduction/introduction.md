# Introduction

## About this Workshop
This workshop is for Java Developers looking to start building applications with Micronaut and Oracle Cloud with Autonomous Database. The workshop features several labs that walk you through the
steps to get going with Micronaut, Helidon, and Oracle Cloud.

Estimated Workshop Time: 120 minutes

### About Micronaut and Helidon

Micronaut is an innovative new server side Java technology that precomputes your framework infrastructure at compilation time. Micronaut can be combined with GraalVM Native Image to build native applications that use less memory and are smaller and faster because of ahead of time compilation technology.

Micronaut also includes a persistence framework called Micronaut Data that precomputes your SQL queries at compilation name making it a great fit for working with Autonomous Database.

Helidon is an Oracle implementation of MicroProfile specification and is used in this lab as a pre-built service to show interaction between heterogeneous microservices.

### Objectives
