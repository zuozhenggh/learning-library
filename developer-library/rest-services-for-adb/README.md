# RESTful Services for your Autonomous Database

## Introduction
Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) is a Java EE-based alternative for Oracle HTTP Server and *mod_plsql*. The Java EE implementation offers increased functionality including a command line based configuration, enhanced security, file caching, and RESTful web services. Oracle REST Data Services also provides increased flexibility by supporting deployments using Oracle WebLogic Server, Apache Tomcat, and a standalone mode.

The Oracle Application Express architecture requires some form of web server to proxy requests between a web browser and the Oracle Application Express engine. Oracle REST Data Services satisfies this need but its use goes beyond that of Oracle Application Express configurations. Oracle REST Data Services simplifies the deployment process because there is no Oracle home required, as connectivity is provided using an embedded JDBC driver.


Watch the video below for a comprehensive overview of REST and how ORDS provides what you need to deliver RESTful Services for your Oracle Database.

### Objectives

-   Enable a user for REST access
-   Publlish a RESTful service for a database table

### Required Artifacts

-   The following lab requires an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/" target="\_blank">Oracle Cloud account</a>. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
* Lab: [Login to Oracle Cloud]()
* Lab: [Provision an Autonomous Database]()


# Developing RESTful Services in Autonomous Database

You have several development interfaces available, including:

  * SQL Developer - Web or Desktop
  * APEX
  * PL/SQL API

In this lab you will use the SQL Developer Web browser-based tool, connect to your Autonomous Database and REST enable tables and views and/or develop custom RESTful Services based on your SQL and PL/SQL code.

## **Step 1:**Connect to your Autonomous Database using SQL Developer Web

## **Step 2:**Create a user for Application development

## **Step 3:**Build a simple GET handler

## **Step 4:**Register an OAUTH Client application

## Conclusion
 In this lab, you had an opportunity to get an introduction to REST services.
