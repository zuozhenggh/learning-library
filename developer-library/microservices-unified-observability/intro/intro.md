## Introduction and Overview

[](youtube:v0nYRueADbo)

This workshop will help you understand the technical capabilities inside and outside the Oracle converged database to support a scalable data and event-driven microservices architecture.

You will create an application with Helidon microservices and a Javascript front-end, using REST and messaging for communication.  The application will be deployed on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Kubernetes cluster (OKE) and access pluggable Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing databases.
