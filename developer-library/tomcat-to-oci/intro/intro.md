# Introduction

## About Workshop

This lab will walk you through the process of migrating an existing 'on-premises' Tomcat application to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. 
The Tomcat application we'll migrate is a Java applications with a datasource connecting to a database that will be migrated to Autonmous Database on OCI alongside the application.

Attached below is a sample architecture of the final solution:

Estimated Lab Time: 30 min.

### About Product/Technology

- Apache Tomcat® is an open source Java application server
- Terraform is an open source engine to deploy "infrastructure-as-code" and is used to deploy the network, compute and database resources

### Objectives

*Perform the end-to-end migration of a Tomcat application to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with an Autonomous Database, provisioning with terraform.*

In this lab, you will:
- Provision a demo environment to use as the 'on-premises' environment to be migrated
- Provision a Tomcat cluster on OCI, with an Autonomous Database with terraform
- Migrate the Application Database from the 'on-premises' environment to the Autonomous Database
- Migrate the Application to the Tomcat deployment on OCI
- Optionally learn to scale the Tomcat cluster
- Tear down the workshop


The reference architecture looks like the following:
