# Tear down the workshop

## About This lab

In this lab, we will tear down the infrastructure deployed on OCI as well as the local Docker environment

Estimated Lab Time: 5min

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Tear down and clean up resources.


## **STEP 1:** Tear down terraform resources

1. Simply run the terraform destroy command

    ```
    <copy>
    terraform destroy
    </copy>
    ```

    You will be prompted to say `yes` to confirm

## **STEP 2:** Tear down the local Docker environment

1. Exit any container you may still be logged into

    ```bash
    <copy>
    exit
    </copy>
    ```

2. Tear down the docker-compose environment
    ```
    <copy>
    docker-compose down
    </copy>
    ```

3. Optionally you may also remove all the unused images and objects

    Attention: this removes anything not in use, so if you have other Docker images you want to keep, you may prefer to selectively delete the images of this workshop only.

    ```
    <copy>
    # Delete all images not in use
    docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)
    # clean up and reduce memory usage
    docker system prune
    </copy>
    ```
