## Introduction 
In this lab you will start both Database and OAS environments by running the script files. 

*Estimated Lab Time:* 10 Mintues.

### Objectives 

- Start the Oracle Database and Listener
- Start OAS services
  
### Prerequisites 

This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:  
- Lab: Generate SSH Key - Cloud Shell
- Lab: Setup Compute Instance  

## **STEP 1**: Starting Database And OAS Services

1. Login to putty using the public ip obtained earlier and switch user to oracle.
      ![](./images/oas-environment1.png " ")
      `````
      <copy>
      sudo su - oracle
      </copy>
      ````` 

2. Go to folder /u01/script

      ````
      <copy>
      cd /u01/script
      </copy>
      ````
3. Run the script file to start the services.
   
      ![](./images/oas-environment2.png " ")
      ````
      <copy>
      ./env_setup_oas-workshop.sh
      </copy>
      ````
  
      All the required services of converged database and OAS will start in 5-6 minutes. 

      ![](./images/oas-environment3.png " ")

      Check for the "Finished starting servers" status before proceeding next.

4. Run "status.sh" file to get the status of all the services required for OAS. 

      ![](./images/oas-environment4.png " ")
      ````
      <copy>
      /u01/oas/Oracle/middleware/Oracle_Home/user_projects/domains/bi/bitools/bin/status.sh 
      </copy>
      ````
 
      The command shows all the service names and their status.

      ![](./images/oas-environment5.png " ")

      Check for the success status as shown above, before login to OAS screen.

## **STEP 2**: Login To Oracle Analytics Server

1. Open web browser (preferabily Chrome) and access the OAS Data Visualization service by the below URL structure.  

      Lab 2 - will provide your instance public IP. 
      ````
      <copy>
      http://Your-Machine-IP:9502/dv/ui
      </copy>
      ````
      ![](./images/oas-environment8.png " ")

2. Login with the below credentials;

      Username	: Weblogic

      Password 	: Oracle_4U

## **STEP 3**: Create A Connection To Database

1. From Home screen, click on **Create** button and select **Connection**.

      ![](./images/oas-environment9.png " ")

2. Select **Oracle Database** for connecting to database and provide required connection details.  

      ![](./images/oas-environment10.png " ")
      ![](./images/oas-environment11.png " ")

      **Connection Details:**	

      | Argument  | Description   |
      | ------------- | ------------- |
      | Connection Name | ConvergedDB_Retail |
      | Connection Type | Basic  |
      | Host | localhost  |
      | Port | 1521  |
      | Service Name | apppdb  |
      | Username | oaslabs  |
