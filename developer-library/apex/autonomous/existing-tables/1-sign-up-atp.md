# Module 1: Signing up for Oracle Autonomous Database

Oracle Application Express (APEX) is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) services. To start, you will need to create an ATP instance and then configure an APEX workspace within your new service. 

### **Part 1**: Acquire an Oracle Cloud trial account

In this part, you will create an Oracle Cloud trial account. If you already have an Oracle Cloud account, and have an APEX Workspace defined you can skip straight to [Module 2](2-creating-an-app-from-a-spreadsheet.md).

1.  Please [click this link to create your free account](https://myservices.us.oraclecloud.com/mycloud/signup?language=en&sourceType). When you complete the registration process you'll receive an account with a $300 credit and several "forever free" services that will enable you to complete the lab for free. You can then use any remaining credit to continue to explore the Oracle Cloud. The forever free services will continue to work after the trial expires.

2.  Soon after requesting your trial you will receive the following email. Once you receive this email you can proceed to Part 2.

### **Part 2**: Log in to your Oracle Cloud account

In this part, you will log into your Oracle Cloud account so that you can start working with various services.

1. Once you receive the **Get Started Now with Oracle Cloud** email, make note of your **Username**, **Password**, and **Cloud Account Name**.

2. From any browser go to https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/sign-in.

3. Enter your **Cloud Account Name** in the input field and click the **Next** button.

4. Enter your **Username** and **Password** in the input fields and click **Sign In**.

### **Part 3**: Create an Autonomous Transaction Processing instance

In this part, you will create an instance of the Autonomous Transaction Processing database service.

1. From the Cloud Dashboard, select the navigation menu icon in the upper left-hand corner and then select **Autonomous Transaction Processing**.

2. Click **Create Autonomous Database**.

3. Select the **Always Free** option, enter **```SecretPassw0rd```** for the ADMIN password, then click **Create Autonomous Database**.

    After clicking **Create Autonomous Database**, you will be redirected to the Autonomous Database Details page for the new instance. Continue to the next part when the status changes from:

    to:

    ![](images/1/status-available.png)

### **Part 4**: Create a new workspace in APEX

When you first access APEX you will need to log in as an APEX Instance Administrator to create a workspace. A workspace is a logical domain where you define APEX applications. Each workspace is associated with one or more database schemas (database users) which are used to store the database objects, such as tables, views, packages, and more. These database objects are generally what APEX applications are built on top of.

1. Click the **Service Console** button.

2. Click the **Development** option in the menu on the left, then click **Oracle APEX**.

3. Enter the password for the Administration Services and click **Sign In to Administration**. The password is the same as the one entered for the ADMIN user when creating the ATP instance: **```SecretPassw0rd```**

    ![](images/1/log-in-as-admin.png)

4. Click **Create Workspace**.

5. Enter the following details and click **Create Workspace**.

    | Property | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Database User | DEMO |
    | Password | **`SecretPassw0rd`** |
    | Workspace Name | DEMO |

    ![](images/1/create-workspace.png)

6. Click the **DEMO** link in the success message. This will log you out of APEX Administration so that you can log into your new workspace.

7. Enter **``SecretPassw0rd``** for the password, check the **Remember workspace and username** checkbox, and then click **Sign In**.

### Summary

This completes the lab setup. At this point, you know how to create a new Autonomous Transaction Processing instance and create an APEX workspace within it. [Click here to navigate to Module 2](2-installing-sample-tables.md)
