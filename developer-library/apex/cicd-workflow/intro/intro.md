# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workdshop will walk you through a typical flow to develop an APEX application and promote it from a dev environment to production (or test or staging environment), using version control to keep track of application code changes as well as schema migrations.

The process takes advantage of Liquibase which is integrated in the SQLcl command line tool, as well as git and APEX specific app management functionalities.

Estimated Lab Time: 45min
