# Building a Proof-of-Concept for Oracle Autonomous Cloud Services

## Introduction
This workshop starts with a napkin design of data structures we would like to use for a proof-of-concept. Using Quick SQL you will quickly define the data structures and utilize various table and column directives to better define the tables and also create some dummy data. You will then be creating an application based on the new tables. Lastly, you will be updating some of the generated components to improve the initial app.

Estimated Time: 55 minutes

### Lab Objectives

* Obtain a free development environment
* Define new tables and views
* Create an application on the new data structures
* Refine the application

*{Note: This lab assumes you are using Oracle APEX 20.1.}*
