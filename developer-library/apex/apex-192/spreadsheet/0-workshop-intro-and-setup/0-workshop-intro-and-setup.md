# Building an App from a Spreadsheet for Oracle Autonomous Cloud Service

## Overview

This lab walks you through uploading a spreadsheet into an Oracle database table, and then creating an application based on this new table. You will then learn to work with the resulting Faceted Search page, Interactive Report and form pages. Finally, you will improve the Calendar page and then link it to the existing form page.

In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets around to gather information, you'll know how to easily create an app in minutes and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!

### Lab Objectives

* Obtain a free development environment
* Build your first app through uploading a Spreadsheet
* Improve the Search and Report pages
* Link pages

*{Note: This lab assumes you are using Oracle APEX 19.2.}*
