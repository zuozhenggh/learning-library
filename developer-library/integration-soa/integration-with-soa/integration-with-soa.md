# Oracle SOA Suite

## Introduction

### What is Service Oriented Architecture, SOA?
SOA is a style of an enterprise IT design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. A SOA service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online. These services are representation of multiple applications that each delivers specific business functions. SOA is also an architectural approach to integration and orchestrating these service. Together, the services perform end to end business flow task. SOA is also intended to be independent of vendors, products and technologies

### About Oracle SOA Suite
SOA suite is a comprehensive, standards-based software suite to build, deploy and manage integration following the concepts of service-oriented architecture(SOA). The components of the suite benefit from consistent tooling, a single deployment and management model, end-to-end security and unified metadata management you can skip this module and go straight to Module 2 by clicking the navigation menu icon, in the upper-left corner of the header.

Oracle SOA Suite provides easy-to-use, reusable, and unified application development tooling and life cycle management support to further reduce development and maintenance costs and complexity. Businesses can improve efficiency and agility through rules-driven, process connectivity and automation with Oracle SOA Suite.

Critical business services, such as customer, financial, ordering information, and others that were previously accessible only in packaged application user interfaces can now be rapidly repurposed for digital-enabled channel such as: smart phone and tablets.

Estimated time taken to complete: 15 minutes

### Objectives
- This lab shows JDeveloper12c as a development platform to construct integration service orchestration. It also show how to access JDeveloper 12c on the Linux OCI.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- SSH Private Key to access the host via SSH
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Generate SSH Keys
    - Lab: Prepare Setup
    - Lab: Environment Setup

## STEP 1: SOA Suite Development, JDeveloper 12c

- SOA development tool, JDeveloper 12c

- Oracle JDeveloper offers complete end-to-end development for Oracle's platform and Oracle's applications.

- To access the JDeveloper environment, you need any modern browser on your laptop or workstation and use the following URL http://[provided ip address]:8080/guacamole with user oracle, password: "Guac.LiveLabs_" note: an underscore character at the end.
- Please review the previous lab, introduction, to find details about accessing a pre-installed JDeveloper on Oracle Linux OCI.
  
## STEP 2: Accessing JDeveloper 12c

Double click on the Oracle JDeveloper 12c icon on the Linux desktop. The following will appear on the desktop:

- ![](./images/jdev-role-selection.png " ")

- For the role, choose Studio Developer (All Features).
- - you may want to uncheck the "Always prompt for role selection on startup"
- Next, click OK button. JDeveloper 12c now opens on your desktop

- Next start the Weblogic server, embedded in default domain of JDeveloper
- - From the application server tab, right click
- - Start server instance
