# Environment Setup

## Introduction

This lab will show you how to start a database instance and listener from a Putty window. You will also setup vncserver and SQLDeveloper.

Estimated time: 10 Minutes

### Objectives
- Start the Oracle Database and Listener
- Download and Setup SQL Developer Client

### Prerequisites

- Lab 1: Login to Oracle Cloud
- Lab 2: Generate SSH Key
- Lab 3: Create Compute Instance

## STEP 1: Start the Database and the Listener

3. In Oracle CloudShell (*recommended*) or the terminal of your choice, login via ssh as the **opc** user.  

      ````
      ssh -i <<sshkeylocation>> opc@<<your address>>
      ````

      - sshkeylocation - Full path of your SSH key
      - your address - Your Public IP Address

4. Switch to the oracle user
      ````
      <copy>sudo su - oracle</copy>
      ````

5.  Run the script env\_setup\_script.sh, this will start the database, listener, oracle rest data service and our eshop application. This script could take 2-5 minutes to run.


      ````
      <copy>cd /u01/script
      ./env_setup_script.sh</copy>
      ````

## STEP 2: Download SQL Developer

Certain workshops require SQL Developer.  To setup SQL Developer, follow the steps below.

1. Download [SQL Developer](https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqldev-downloads.html) from the Oracle.com site and install on your local system.

2. Once installed, open up the SQL Developer console.

## STEP 3:  Test a connection

1.  In the connections page click the green plus to create a new connection

2.  Enter the following connection information to test your connection:
      - **Name**: CDB
      - **Username**: system
      - **Password**: Oracle_4U
      - **Hostname**: <instance_publicIP>
      - **Port**: 1521
      - **SID**: convergedcdb

    ![](./images/sql_developer_connection.png " ")

3.  Once your connection is successful in the SQL Developer panel execute the query below
      ````
      <copy>select name, open_mode from v$database;</copy>
      ````
