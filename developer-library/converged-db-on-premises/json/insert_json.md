# Oracle JSON 

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps of inserting and updating json data. We can use standard database APIs to insert or update JSON data. We can work directly with JSON data contained in file-system files by creating an external table that exposes it to the database.
In this lab we can add a row to our json table using insert query and  we can use Oracle SQL function json_mergepatch to update specific portions of a JSON document.

## Before You Begin

**What Do You Need?**

This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
- Lab 1:  Login to Oracle Cloud
- Lab 2:  Generate SSH Key
- Lab 3:  Create Compute instance 
- Lab 4:  Environment setup
- Note :  All scripts for this lab are stored in the /u01/workshop/json folder and are run as the oracle user.

## Step 1: Insert a record.

  a. **Take a count of the rows in the json table-**

  ````
    <copy>
    select count(*) from purchase_order;
    </copy>
  ````
    
  ![](./images/insert_json.PNG " ")  

 b. Insert a record.

  ````
    <copy>
    INSERT INTO purchase_order
  VALUES (
    SYS_GUID(),
to_date('05-MAY-2020'),
    '{"PONumber"             : 10001,
      "Reference"            : "SBELL-20141017",
      "Requestor"            : "Sarah Bell",
      "User"                 : "SBELL",
      "CostCenter"           : "A50",
      "ShippingInstructions" : {"name"    : "Sarah Bell",
                  "Address" : {"street"  : "200 Sporting Green",
                              "city"    : "South San Francisco",
                              "state"   : "CA",
                              "zipCode" : 99236,
                        "country" : "United States of America"},
                        "Phone"   : "983-555-6509"},
      "Special Instructions" : "Courier",
      "LineItems"            : [{"ItemNumber" : 1,
             "Part"       : {"Description" : "Making the Grade",
                             "UnitPrice"   : 20,
                             "UPCCode"     : 27616867759},
             "Quantity"   : 8.0},
                              {"ItemNumber" : 2,
             "Part"       : {"Description" : "Nixon",
                                "UnitPrice"   : 19.95,
                                "UPCCode"     : 717951002396},
                                 "Quantity"   : 5},
                                {"ItemNumber" : 3,
          "Part"       : {"Description" : "Eric Clapton: Best Of 1981-1999",
                               "UnitPrice"   : 19.95,
                               "UPCCode"     : 75993851120},
                                 "Quantity"   : 5.0}
                                ]}');

    
             </copy>
  ````
   
The above insert query is also available as a sql file in the directory “/u01/workshop/json”.
The script is called as insert.sql. You can run this connecting to the SQL prompt.

Set your oracle environment and connect to PDB.
 ````
    <copy>
. oraenv
ConvergedCDB
sqlplus appjson/Oracle_4U@JXLPDB
SQL>@insert.sql
</copy>
   ````
    


c. **Verify the count after insert.**

  
  ````
    <copy>
   Select * from purchase_order j where j.po_document.PONumber=10001;
    
    </copy>
   ````
    
    
  ![](./images/json_select_count1.PNG " ")
   
  
## Step 2: Update Table.
  We can use Oracle SQL function json-mergepatch or PL/SQL object-type method json-mergepatch() to update specific portions of a JSON document. In both cases we provide a JSON Merge Patch document, which declaratively specifies the changes to make to a a specified JSON document. JSON Merge Patch is an IETF standard.    
   
   ````
    <copy>
    update purchase_order
     set    PO_DOCUMENT = json_mergepatch ( 
         PO_DOCUMENT,
         '{
           "Requestor" : "MSDhoni"
         }'
       )
    where id ='A4E055B4CF4A23A4E0530900000A60C2';

    </copy>
    
  ````

 
The above update query is also available as a sql file in the directory “/u01/workshop/json”.
The script is called as update.sql. You can run this to the SQL prompt.

 ````
    <copy>
    
SQL>@update.sql

  </copy>
    
  ````
