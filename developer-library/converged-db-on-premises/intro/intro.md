# Introduction and Overview

## Oracle Converged Database

### Data Driven Application Challenges

Modern data driven applications are bringing in a lot more complexity with different data types (Relational, Document, Spatial, Graph) and workloads (Transactions, analytics, ML,IOT). These require different database algorithms to solve and the two possible data strategies is Single Purpose best of breed database for each data type and workload OR use a converged database for all data types and workloads. 

Once we have a single purpose separate database for spatial, ML, Blockchain, JSON, graph etc. we are actually introducing a lot many variables which inherently is increasing the complexity.

Single purpose Database would eventually end up doing a lot of custom work, writing more code independently using individual Proprietary API's and transaction models. Propagating and transforming all these changes with fragmented data all over the place creates lot more complexity and there is definitely a need to integrate it with a lot of customizations. This Integration is a job that never ends.

The necessary features like security, availability, scalability are just very complex to achieve, as each of them has its own models to be built. Later, to propagate any of the smallest change and integrate its a huge activity. 

Availability, scalability, consistency, End to End security etc. are very limited in their areas by weakest of their databases that are implemented. Combining all of them gives worst of weakness. These systems are JUST NO economies of scale.


### Solving the Challenge
Oracle has been doing decades of innovation meeting the needs of mission critical complex systems by doing automation and this journey is continuing with emerging needs and solving the real-world challenges like real time analytics, scale out architecture, zero down time, defend on cyberattacks. This automation expands to Infrastructure, database, Automated Data center operations and machine learning. 

Like, originally, we had Calendar, messaging, clock, camera as individual products and now are part of Mobile device. Similarly, key-value, ML, JSON, Transactional, Sharding earlier individual products but now are features of Converged DB.  

Converged Database architecture approach creates the Data synergy and simplicity. Synergy across features makes the whole better than sum of parts. Oracle Converged Database Supports all Workloads (Traditional, Next Generation) and Datatypes (Structured & Un-Structured )

Converged DB makes it much simpler to develop apps. Just call the SQL to run ML, GRAPH, Spatial, JSON, Blockchain etc.

Oracle converged DB on On-premise or on Oracle Cloud Delivers Union of Best Capabilities for each of data type and Workload. 
All those bottlenecks (Data Consistency, Data Security, Availability, Scalability, Cross Site Consistency) of single purpose database are solved in Oracle Converged Database. 

All of these capabilities create better and informed decisions by increasing the value of information and reducing the time to business insight.
