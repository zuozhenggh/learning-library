## Introduction to Property Graph

**What Are Property Graphs?** 

A property graph consists of a set of objects or vertices, and a set of arrows or edges connecting the objects. Vertices and edges can have multiple properties, which are represented as key-value pairs.

**Each vertex has a unique identifier and can have:**

- A set of outgoing edges
- A set of incoming edges
- A collection of properties

**Each edge has a unique identifier and can have:**

- An outgoing vertex
- An incoming vertex
- A text label that describes the relationship between the two vertices
- A collection of properties


The following figure illustrates a very simple property graph with two vertices and one edge. The two vertices have identifiers 1 and 2. Both vertices have properties name and age. The edge is from the outgoing vertex 1 to the incoming vertex 2. The edge has a text label knows and a property type identifying the type of relationship between vertices 1 and 2.
