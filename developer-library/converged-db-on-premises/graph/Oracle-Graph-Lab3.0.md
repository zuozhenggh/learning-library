<br>
**Visualize the Graph**

We will use the Graph Visualization component to run some PGQL queries and visualize the results as a graph instead of a tabular result.

GraphViz should be accessible at host:7007/ui

The principal points of entry for the GraphViz application are the query editor and the graph lists.
When you start GraphViz, the graph list will be populated with the graphs loaded in the graph server. To run queries against a graph, select that graph. The query lets you write PGQL queries that can be visualized. (PGQL is the SQL-like query language supported by GraphViz.)

Once the query is ready and the desired graph is selected, click Run to execute the query.

We will add two conditions that match cancelled or refunded orders.

Select Apply To Vertices (i.e. the conditions apply to Vertices)

Click on the +  sign to add a condition

Choose label = ORDERS

Again, Click + sign  to add another condition

Choose ORDER_STATUS = CANCELLED

Click the checkbox for Color (vertex color) and choose a red color from the color-picker

![](./images/IMGG28.PNG)

Scroll down and enter Cancelled as the Legend Title and then Click Add Highlight.

Repeat the above process to add one more highlight for Refunded Orders.

Select Apply To Vertices (i.e. the conditions apply to Vertices)

Click on the +  sign to add a condition

Choose label = ORDERS

Click + to add another condition

Choose ORDER_STATUS = REFUNDED

Click the checkbox for Color (vertex color) and choose a yellow color from the color-picker

Set the Legend Title to Refunded

Then Click Add Highlight.

**Deleting the Graph**

Once you are done using PGViz at host:7007/ui and trying some other PGQL queries then execute the following statements to delete the in-memory graph 

````
<copy>
graph.destroy();
</copy>
````
