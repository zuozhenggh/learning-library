# Setup an 'on-premises' environment using the workshop marketplace stack.

## Introduction: 

This 10 mins lab walks you through setting up anenvironment to simulate an established on-premises environment, using a Compute instance on OCI deployed through the marketplace. 

Note: This is an alternative to Lab 2b: Setup local (on-premises) environment using Docker. You only need to setup your 'on-premises' environment using one or the other.

At the end of this lab, you will have a simulated 'on-premises' environment running with an Oracle 12c Database and WebLogic Server 12c with a domain containing 2 applications and a datasource.

## Requirements

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account, with proper credentials to create resources</br>
  <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/" target="_blank">https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/</a>

## Step 1: Launch the Workshop Marketplace stack

- Navigate to <a href="https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/listing/82173888" target="_blank">Workshop Environment Marketplace Stack</a>

- Click **Get App**

- Sign in to your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Account

  <img src="./images/sign-in.png"  width="50%">

- Choose a compartment

  <img src="./images/wls-workshop-mp1.png"  width="100%">

- Accept the Terms and Conditions and click **Launch**

  <img src="./images/wls-workshop-mp2.png"  width="100%">

- Click **Next**

  <img src="./images/next.png"  width="70%">

- Paste your **SSH public key**

   To connect to the WebLogic servers via SSH, you need to provide a public key the server will use to identify your computer.

  <img src="./images/ssh-key.png"  width="50%">

   To output the public key information, use the following command from your local machine:
   ```
   <copy>
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   </copy>
   ```
   Copy the output of the command (the whole multi-line output) and paste it in the form field for SSH key in the form

   the output will look something like this:

   ```bash
   ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDlkF23qLyfimJ9Vp4D9psp7bDOB8JvtY/pfYzFxIA2E4v6or+XhvMW5RDhX9Ba54zQNNDLvwUhStdXKkiMXJtEQJarFn45pGy/lyUQKFJolAdHBrXJsg5XWn4DxCFeQUQe1szVfmwDLAktAS14r5g76h3CcA8Kk/cNVqevxVChyejuuOdtAMoriIC8uKV+535qPs/GMiu0zR9aW4w1VodL5eHnXjqdgp8Fr21dVUVQ6of+s/ws0zlQUwghrNguDUqlggzG2mpLBHExypxCrJYmsb05uYjjqVlC3YCatj4nJTIHKLCFiYVY/b8AFkqwXV9EYlja5bjTmunM847dcR8H oracle@ad753161734c
   ```
   **Note:** Do not use the example above as the key: it is a different public key which is useless without the corresponding private key, and you will not be able to access your resources on OCI)

- Click **Next** and then **Create**

It will take about 1 to 2 minutes to create the stack. When the job finishes, you can find the Public IP address of the instance at the bottom of the logs, or in the **Output** area

## Step 2:  Check the local environment is up and running

It will take another 4 to 5 minutes for all the services to come online.

The console will be available at <a href="">http://PUBLIC-IP:7001/console</a> and the WebLogic admin user is `weblogic` with password `welcome1`

Before proceeding, make sure the local environment has been deployed properly and is running. 

  <img src="./images/localhost-admin-console.png"  width="100%">

The **SimpleDB** application should be running at <a href="">http://PUBLIC-IP:7003/SimpleDB/</a>

It shows statistics of riders of the Tour de France stored in the database, and looks like this:

## Step 3: Log in to the 'on-premises' environment

Most of the work will be done from the simulated on-premises environment deployed in the compute instance on OCI.

To log into the instance, use:

```bash
ssh opc@<public-ip>
```
Replace the `<public-ip>` with the IP provided in the output of the provisioning job.

## Step 4: Create a SSH key

We'll need a SSH key pair to communicate with the WebLogic servers and the database on OCI. The public key will need to be provided when provisioning those resources. 

We'll create a SSH key pair in the default folder

- Once on the compute instance on OCI, switch to the oracle user:

```bash
<copy>
sudo su - oracle
</copy>
```

- Create the SSH keypair

```bash
<copy>
ssh-keygen
</copy>
```
and just hit `Enter` (default) for all the prompts

- You will find two files `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` inside the folder `~/.ssh/` or `/home/oracle/.ssh/`

   `id_rsa` is the private key, which should never be shared, and will be required to connect to any OCI resource provisioned with the corresponding public key `id_rsa.pub`

   Note this key will be the default SSH key from the instance used for the on-premises environment.

**Note:** This is only to be done once. If you run it again, a new key will overwrite the previous one and you will lose access to any resource provisioned with that key.
