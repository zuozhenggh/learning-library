# Provision WebLogic on Oracle Kubernetes Engine

## Introduction

This lab walks you through provisioning the WebLogic Infrastructure on OKE by leveraging the OCI Marketplace.

Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab you will:

- Provision WebLogic Server on Oracle Kubernetes Engine via the Marketplace offering
- Gather information for further steps

### Prerequisites

For this lab, you need to have prepared the OCI tenancy with:

- A Vault
- A Key
- A Secret for the WebLogic Admin password
- A Secret for the OCI Registry Auth Token


## **STEP 1:** Provision the stack through the Marketplace

1. Go to **Solutions and Platforms**

  <img src="./images/provision-1.png" width="50%">

2. In the search input, type "`weblogic`". For this lab, we'll use the **WebLogic Enterprise Edition on OKE UCM**

   <img src="./images/provision-2.png" width="100%">

3. Make sure you are in the **Compartment** you want to use, use the **default WebLogic version** available, accept the License agreement and click **Launch the Stack**

   <img src="./images/provision-3.png" width="100%">

4. **Name** the stack and click **Next**

   <img src="./images/provision-4.png" width="100%">

5. **Enter** a **Resource Name Prefix**.

  It will be used to prefix the name of all the resources (domain, managed servers, admin server, cluster, machines...)

  The next steps in this workshop assumes the resource name prefix is `nonjrf`, so it is highly recommended to use this name.

6. **SSH key**

   To connect to the WebLogic servers via SSH, you need to provide a public key the server will use to identify your computer. 
   
   *Since the various commands will be ran from inside the 'on-premises' environment (either the workshop compute instance or the local docker containers), you will need to provide the key generated in the 'on-premises' environment.*

  <img src="./images/provision-8-sshkey.png" width="70%">

   To output the public key information, use the following command from inside the 'on-premises' environment as the `oracle` user.
    ```
    <copy>
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    </copy>
    ```
    Copy the output of the command (the whole multi-line output) and paste it in the form field for SSH key in the form

    the output will look something like this:

    ```bash
    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDlkF23qLyfimJ9Vp4D9psp7bDOB8JvtY/pfYzFxIA2E4v6or+XhvMW5RDhX9Ba54zQNNDLvwUhStdXKkiMXJtEQJarFn45pGy/lyUQKFJolAdHBrXJsg5XWn4DxCFeQUQe1szVfmwDLAktAS14r5g76h3CcA8Kk/cNVqevxVChyejuuOdtAMoriIC8uKV+535qPs/GMiu0zR9aW4w1VodL5eHnXjqdgp8Fr21dVUVQ6of+s/ws0zlQUwghrNguDUqlggzG2mpLBHExypxCrJYmsb05uYjjqVlC3YCatj4nJTIHKLCFiYVY/b8AFkqwXV9EYlja5bjTmunM847dcR8H oracle@ad753161734c
    ```
    **Note:** Do not use the example above as the key: it is a different public key which is useless without the corresponding private key, and you will not be able to access your resources on OCI)

7. Keep the default of *2* for **Managed Server Count** 

8. Use the standard *weblogic* for **Administration User Name**

  <img src="./images/provision-11-admin-name.png" width="70%">

9. **Paste** the **OCID** of the **Secret** generated previously for the **Secret OCID for Administration Password**

  <img src="./images/provision-12-secret.png" width="70%">

10. Click the **WebLogic Advanced Configuration** and enter the name **nonjrf_domain** for the domain name

  <img src="./images/domain-name.png" width="70%">

11. Under **WebLogic Cluster (OKE) Configuration**, the Kubernetes version is default and select a **Shape** you have available in your tenancy.

   In a real world situation, choose a shape appropriate to handle the load of a single managed server. Since we're using a trial account, choose the **VM.Standard.E2.1** shape, the **VM.Standard.E2.2** shape or a suitable shape that is available in your tenancy.

   <img src="./images/shape.png" width="70%">

   To check shape availability, you can go to **Governance -> Limits and Quotas** in another tab, and verify you have a specific shape available

12. Select the **Number of Nodes in the WebLogic Pool** to 1 for now 

   <img src="./images/node-in-wls-pool.png" width="70%">

13. Select a shape and number of nodes for the non-WebLogic pool (for infra services like Jenkins)

   <img src="./images/node-in-non-wls-pool.png" width="70%">

14. Keep the **CIDR** block the default

   <img src="./images/cidr.png" width="70%">

15. Under **Container Cluster (OKE) Administration Instances**, select an **Availability Domain** and shapes for the **Administration Server Compute Shape** and **Bastion Instance Shape**

   <img src="./images/admin-bastion-shape.png" width="70%">

16. Under **Network**, select **Create New VCN** and keep the other defaults

   <img src="./images/create-vcn.png" width="70%">

17. For **Database**, select **No Database**. This is only needed for a JRF domain. We will provision the application database separately.

   <img src="./images/no-database.png" width="70%">

18. Select an **Availability Domain** for the **File System**

   <img src="./images/file-system-ad.png" width="70%">

19. Under Registry (OCIR) enter your full **Username**, which you find under you **User icon**

   <img src="./images/username.png" width="40%">

20. and enter the **OCID** of the Secret for the **OCI Registry Auth Token**

   <img src="./images/ocir-secret.png" width="70%">

21. and then click **Create**

  <img src="./images/provision-25.png" width="100%">

22. The stack will get provisioned using the **Resource Manager**. This may take 7-15min.

  <img src="./images/provision-26.png" width="100%">

Once the stack is provisioned, you can find the information regarding the URL and IP of the WebLogic Admin server in the logs, or in the **Outputs** left-side menu.

## **STEP 2:** Gather deployment information

1. Go to **Outputs** (or you can find the same information at the bottom of the logs)

  You should see something like the following:

  <img src="./images/provision-28.png" width="100%">

  - Make a note of the **WebLogic Admin Server Private IP address** from the **WebLogic Admin Server Console URL** for later use.

  - Make a note of the **Load Balancer IP** for later use.

  - Make a note of the Bastion Instance **Public IP address** for later use.

  To access the WebLogic Admin console, you will need to create a tunnel through the bastion host to your local machine.

  We'll need to setup a tunnel through the Bastion Instance, with a dynamic port to connect to the Admin Console and the Jenkins UI with the browser.

## **STEP 3:** Setup connectivity

1. Extract the SSH key from the 'on-premises' environment:

  In the *Docker* environment, the key pair (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`) is exported for you in the `weblogic-to-oci/ssh/` folder

  If your used the Marketplace demo image, you need to extract the key to your local machine.

  Since we only have SSH access with the `opc` user, the key first needs to be moved to the opc user home and then exported.

  In the 'on-premises' VM, as the oracle user

    ```bash
    <copy>
    sudo cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa /home/opc/
    </copy>
    ```

  Then exit the oracle user shell, and exit the VM, by typing `exit` twice

  Then on your local machine shell:

    ```bash
    <copy>
    mkdir ssh
    scp opc@<DEMO_ENV_IP>:~/id_rsa ./ssh/
    </copy>
    ```

  The key `id_rsa` will now be in your local folder

2. Create a dynamic port tunnel through the Bastion Instance

  Use the following command to create a tunnel from the WLS admin server to your local machine.

    ```bash
    <copy>
    ssh -i ./ssh/id_rsa -C -D 1088 opc@$<BASTION_IP>
    </copy>
    ```

  Using Putty:
  - Create a new Session to `opc@<BASTION_IP>` with port 22
  - In **Host Keys**, locate the `id_rsa` private key obtained earlier
  - In **Connections -> SSH -> Tunnels**, click **Dynamic**
  - Enter **Source Port: 1088** then **Add**
  - Click **Open** to open the tunnel connection

3. Setup Socksv5 Proxy in Firefox

  In Firefox browser, go to **Preferences**

  - Search for **Proxy**

    <img src="./images/firefox-proxy1.png" width="60%">

  - Click **Settings**
  - Click **Manual Proxy** setup
  - Enter **localhost** and port **1088**

    <img src="./images/firefox-proxy2.png" width="60%">

## **Step 4:** Check the deployment

1. Find the private load balancer IP under **Core Infrastructure -> Networking -> Load Balancers**

2. Find the load balancer marked *Private* and note the IP address

  <img src="./images/lb-oke.png" width="60%">

3. In Firefox, go to *http://`PRIVATE_LOAD_BALANCER_IP`/console* to find the WebLogic Admin console

  <img src="./images/wls-empty.png" width="100%">

  You should find the deployment list is empty under **Deployments**

4. Go to *http://`PRIVATE_LOAD_BALANCER_IP`/jenkins* to get to the Jenkins Console

  You will be prompted to create a default admin user, and then you can see the Jenkins UI and pipelines

You can proceed to the next lab
