# Access Bob's Book Application and Explore Verrazzano and Other Consoles

## Introduction

In Lab 3, we deployed the Bob's Book application. In this lab, we will access the application and verify that it is working. Later, we will explore the Verrazzano and Grafana consoles.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Access the Bob's Book application.
* Explore the Verrazzano console.
* Explore the Grafana console.

### Prerequisites

* Run Lab 1, which creates an OKE Cluster on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
* Run Lab 2, which installs Verrazzano on a Kubernetes cluster.
* Run Lab 3, which deploys the Bob's Book application.
* You should have a text editor, where you can paste the commands and URLs and modify them, as per your environment. Then you can copy and paste the modified commands for running them in the *Cloud Shell*.

## Task 1: Access the Bob's Book application

1. We need an `EXTERNAL_IP` address through which we can access the Bob's Book application. To get the `EXTERNAL_IP` address of the istio-ingressgateway service, copy the following command and paste it in the *Cloud Shell*.

      ```bash
      <copy> kubectl get service \
      -n "istio-system" "istio-ingressgateway" \
      -o jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}; echo</copy>
      ```

   The output should be similar to the following:
      ```bash
         $ kubectl get service \
         > -n "istio-system" "istio-ingressgateway" \
         > -o jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}; echo
         XX.XX.XX.XX
      ```
2. To open the Robert's Book Store Home Page, copy the following URL and replace *XX.XX.XX.XX* with your *EXTERNAL_IP* address which we got in the last step, as shown in the following image.

      ```bash
      <copy>https://bobs-books.bobs-books.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io/</copy>
      ```

   ![Roberts Books Page](images/2.png " ")

3. Click *Advanced*, as shown:

   ![Advanced](images/3.png " ")

4. Select *Proceed to bobs-books.bobs-books. EXTERNAL_IP .nip.io(unsafe)* to access the application.

   ![Unsafe access](images/4.png " ")

   ![Robert Bookstore](images/5.png " ")

5. To open the Bob's Book Store Home page, open a new tab and copy the following URL and replace *XX.XX.XX.XX* with your `EXTERNAL_IP` address, as shown in the following image.

      ```bash
      <copy>https://bobs-books.bobs-books.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io/bobbys-front-end/</copy>
      ```

   ![Bobs bookstore](images/6.png " ")

   ![Bob bookstore](images/7.png " ")

   > Leave this page open  because we will use it in Lab 8.

6. To open the Bob's Book Order Manager UI, open a new tab and copy the following URL and replace *XX.XX.XX.XX* with your *EXTERNAL_IP* address as shown in the following image.

      ```bash
      <copy>https://bobs-books.bobs-books.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io/bobs-bookstore-order-manager/orders</copy>
      ```

   ![order manager](images/8.png " ")

7. Go Back to the *Bob's Books* page and let's purchase a book. Click *Books* as shown in the following image.

   ![Check out order](images/38.png " ")

8. Select the image for the *Twilight* Book, as shown in the following image.

   ![Purchase book](images/39.png " ")

9. First, click *Add to cart* and then *Checkout* as shown in the following image.

   ![Purchase book](images/40.png " ")

10. Enter the details for purchasing the book. For *Your State*, enter your two digit state code and then click *Submit Order*.

   ![Purchase book](images/42.png " ")
11. Go back to the *Order Manager* page and select the *Refresh* button to check if your order is successfully recorded in the order manager.

   ![Verify Order](images/11.png " ")

## Task 2: Explore the Verrazzano Console

Verrazzano installs several consoles. The endpoints for an installation are stored in the `Status` field of the installed Verrazzano Custom Resource.

1. You can get the endpoints for these consoles by using the following command:

      ```bash
      <copy>kubectl get vz -o jsonpath="{.items[].status.instance}" | jq .</copy>
      ```

   The output should be similar to the following:
      ```bash
      $ kubectl get vz -o jsonpath="{.items[].status.instance}" | jq .
      {
      "consoleUrl": "https://verrazzano.default.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io",
      "elasticUrl": "https://elasticsearch.vmi.system.default.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io",
      "grafanaUrl": "https://grafana.vmi.system.default.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io",
      "keyCloakUrl": "https://keycloak.default.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io",
      "kialiUrl": "https://kiali.vmi.system.default.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io",
      "kibanaUrl": "https://kibana.vmi.system.default.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io",
      "prometheusUrl": "https://prometheus.vmi.system.default.1XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io",
      "rancherUrl": "https://rancher.default.XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io"
      }
      $
      ```
    Click the links to open the *Verrazzano* Console.

2. Click *Advanced*.

   ![Advanced](images/14.png " ")

3. Select *Proceed to verrazzano default XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io(unsafe)*.

   ![Proceed](images/15.png " ")

4. Because it redirects to the Keycloak console  URL for authentication, again on this page, click *Advanced*.

   ![Keycloak Authentication](images/16.png " ")

5. Select *Proceed to Keycloak default XX.XX.XX.XX.nip.io(unsafe)*.

   ![Proceed](images/17.png " ")

6. Now we need the user name and password for the Verrazzano console. *Username* is *verrazzano* and to find out the password, go back to the *Cloud Shell* and paste the following command to find out the password for the *Verrazzano Console*.

      ```bash
      <copy>kubectl get secret --namespace verrazzano-system verrazzano -o jsonpath={.data.password} | base64 --decode; echo</copy>
      ```

   The output should be similar to the following:
      ```bash
      $ kubectl get secret --namespace verrazzano-system verrazzano -o jsonpath={.data.password} | base64 --decode; echo
      aBsNxxZnl1ea3Vzp
      $
      ```

7. Copy the password and go back to the browser, where the *Verrazzano Console* is open.

   ![Verrazzano login](images/36.png " ")

8. Paste the password in the *Password* field and enter *verrazzano* as *Username* and then click *Sign In*.

   ![SignIn](images/19.png " ")

   In the Home Page of the Verrazzano Console, you can see *System Telemetry* and because we installed the *Development Profile* of Verrazzano, you can see it in the *General Information* section.

   ![Home Page](images/20.png " ")

9. Because we have deployed the Bob's Book application, you can see it under *OAM Applications*. Select *bobs-books* to view different components of this application.

   ![Components](images/21.png " ")

   There are 10 components for this application as you can see under *Components*.

10. To explore the configuration for a particular component, first select the *Sort by* drop-down menu and select *Name*, then select the *bobby-coh* component as shown:

    ![bobs-coh](images/22.png " ")

11. You can see *General Information* for this component. To learn about the *Workload Spec*, select *bobby-coh* as shown:

    ![Workload spec](images/23.png " ")
