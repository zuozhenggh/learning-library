# Introduction to Labs and Workshops                                   

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to **develop labs and workshops**.

## What are Labs and Workshops?
A lab is a new model adopted by the DB organization to enhance the tutorial experience. Labs are what we all commonly know as Oracle by example (OBE). Labs can be combined to form a workshop, formerly known as Hands-on Lab or HOL, or a Learning Path.

An individual Markdown (.md) file is called a lab.
A collection of labs is called a workshop.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based version control system designed for software developers.
  * At the core of GitHub is Git, an open source version control system that manages file versions and tracks the changes made by the members of a repository.
  * The Hub is a cloud-based repository that manages storage of the files and provides a folder structure.

## GitHub Projects and Repositories
* GitHub is organized by projects.
* Each project has its own repository (commonly referred to as repo) that is accessed
through a unique URL.

## Oracle GitHub Project and learning-library Repository

  **Note**: The term "learning-library" is NOT the same as Oracle Learning Library (OLL) used formerly in the OBE world. The Oracle Learning Library (OLL) is an online resource for content about Oracle products [https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:1](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:1), whereas "learning-library" is the GitHub repository that is accessed through a unique URL: [https://github.com/oracle/learning-library](https://github.com/oracle/learning-library).

## GitHub Workflow
The following flow chart shows the process that your need to follow to set up the environment for developing labs and workshops:

## Workshop Objectives
  * Set up the GitHub environment.
  * Install and use GitHub Desktop Client.
  * Fork the learning-library repository (copy repository content to GitHub).
  * Clone your forked learning-library repository (copy repository content to local machine).
  * Understand the lab folders' structure.
  * Install and use Atom Editor to and the Markdown templates to develop content.
  * Perform GitHub operations to commit your developed content to the master (production) learning-library on GitHub.
  * Host workshops and labs on the Oracle Help Center (OHC).


## Lab Breakdown
- **Lab 1:** Get Started with Git and Set up the Environment
- **Lab 2:** Understand the Folder Structure
- **Lab 3:** Use Atom Editor and Live Server to Develop Content
