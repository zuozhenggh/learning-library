3.	Is this just for certain regions? Certain groups?

    -	We have content that supports certification. You can shortlist the workshops based on Focus Area, Product, and other filters on the right side of the LiveLabs workshops catalog. Please check with Oracle University for certification assistance.
5.	How to view/Do we get the report of who is running the workshops?
    -	Brown buttons
        - We track only the view count of the workshop, i.e., The number of hits for the apex link of a workshop. We do not track usage, it violates privacy rules set up by security and legal.
        - The views report is only available to Oracle employees, you must login with your SSO to view it.
        - To get the view count, go to [LiveLabs](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=133:1) homepage, click the Question mark icon on the top right corner of the page, then select Dashboard.
        - Scroll down the Dashboard to the Workshop Views, select your workshop from the drop-down list.
    -	Green button
        - We track who took a workshop on the LiveLabs tenancy. We are allowed via CSSAP to track the workshop id and email for those who click the green button.
6.	Which link should I share?
    -	Share only the Apex URLs for the workshops in production. This helps in tracking the views for the workshop by counting the number of hits on the Apex URL of the workshop.
    -	Don’t share the github.io links, we do not track this URL and that may change.
7.	How to look for a specific workshop to run?
    -	Search in [LiveLabs](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=133:1). It is self-service.

10.	Is there a way to view the workshop instructions without reserving a workshop and securing an environment?
    -	Workshops and environments do not have to be reserved. All workshops can be executed on-demand on any kind of environment, freetier, or paid.  Only certain workshops run and are pre-provisioned on an oracle tenancy.  A customer would not reserve an environment to execute a workshop on the freetier, it’s on-demand. Click on any of the brown buttons to view the workshop instructions.
11.	What to do if I am unable to launch green button?
    -	If you are already logged into your own tenancy when clicking on a Livelabs link, the livelabs reservation login link will skip the login (because according to the system you have already authenticated to your own tenancy) and tries to navigate to the assigned Livelabs tenancy. Please make sure you are logged off completely from your own tenancy or use another (private) browser window to connect.
12.	What is the difference is between LiveLabs vs Luna?
    -	The main difference between LiveLabs and Luna is use case. LiveLabs is a deal and consumption focused while Luna is learn focused. The goal of LiveLabs is not to learn but to drive customer consumption and support events. The combination of the two give a full solution for Oracle.
