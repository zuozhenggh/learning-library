# Introduction

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to get started using the **Oracle Autonomous Database on Shared Infrastructure (ADB-S)**. You will provision a new ADB instance, load data from the object store and troubleshoot data loads, query external data residing on the object store, manage an ADB instance, scale an ADB instance, and use Oracle Machine Learning notebooks.

With Oracle Autonomous Database, we make it quick and easy for you to create a secure, fully managed database service in the Oracle Cloud which enables you to start loading and analyzing your data immediately.

## **What is an Oracle Autonomous Database?**
Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse and Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing are built around the market-leading Oracle database. They come with fully automated data warehouse and transaction processing specific features that deliver outstanding query performance. This environment provides a fully managed cloud service running on optimized high-end Oracle hardware systems. You don’t need to spend time thinking about how you should store your data, when or how to back it up, or how to tune your queries. We take care of everything for you.

Oracle’s Autonomous Database is the perfect quick-start service for fast data loading and sophisticated data reporting and analysis. Oracle manages everything for you, so you can focus on your data.

Estimated workshop time: 3 hours and 45 minutes

## **Workshop objectives**
- Get comfortable with Oracle's public cloud services
- Provision a new Autonomous Database instance on Shared Infrastructure
- Run sample queries on the sample data sets
