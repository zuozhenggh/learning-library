# Introduction

## About This Workshop

This workshop introduces key graph data modeling and analysis concepts and the interactive Graph Studio for working with graphs in an Autonomous Database.

Estimated Workshop Time: 60 minutes

### About Autonomous Graph 
Oracle Autonomous Database contains features that enable it to function as a scalable property graph database. They automate the creation of graph models and in-memory graphs from database tables. They  include notebooks and developer APIs for executing graph queries using PGQL, a SQL-like graph query language, and nearly 60 built-in graph algorithms, and offer dozens of visualizations including native graph visualization.

### Objectives

In this workshop you will:
* Connect to your autonomous database using *Graph Studio*
* Quickly create a graph from scratch using PGQL (a graph query language)
* Load graphs into memory for analysis
* Create a notebook
* Write and execute basic Markdown, PGX Java and PGQL notebook paragraphs
* Visualize graph data
 
### Prerequisites
* Oracle Cloud Account
* Provisioned ADB-Shared instance
