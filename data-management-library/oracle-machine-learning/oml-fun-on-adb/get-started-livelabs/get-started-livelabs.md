# Get started with Oracle Cloud Free Tier Setup

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to set up your Oracle Cloud Free Tier environment that includes provisioning an Oracle Autonomous Database, and signing into Oracle Machine Learning user interface.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to:

* Provision an Oracle Autonomous Database
* Create an Oracle Machine Learning user
* Sign into Oracle Machine Learning user interface
* Create the CUSTOMERS360 table.

	> **Note:** You will use this table in the _Using Oracle Machine Learning AutoML UI_ lab and _Using Oracle Machine Learning Services_ lab.

### Prerequisites

* Sign up for a Free Tier Oracle Cloud account.

> **Note:** You may see differences in account details (eg: Compartment Name is different in different places) as you work through the labs. This is because the workshop was developed using different accounts over time.


## Task 1: Provision an Oracle Autonomous Database

To provision an Oracle Autonomous Database:

1. Sign into your OCI account, and under the Launch Resources section, click **Create an ADW database**.

7. Click **Create** on the Oracle Machine Learning User Administration page.

	![Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse](images/oml-um-page.png)

8. On the Create User page, enter the following details to create the user:

	![Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse](images/omluser-creation.png)

	* **Username:** Enter a username for the account. Using the username, the user will log in to an Oracle Machine Learning instance.
	* **First Name:** Enter the first name of the user.
	* **Last Name:**  Enter the first name of the user.
	* **Email Address:** Enter the email ID of the user.
	* Deselect the option **Generate password and email account details to user. User will be required to reset the password on first sign in**. This option auto generates a temporary password and sends an email with the account credentials to the user. If you select this option, you need not define the password in the **Password** and **Confirm Password** fields, as these two fields are disabled.
	* **Password:** Enter a password for the user.
		> **Note:** This option is disabled if you select the **Generate password...** option to auto generate a temporary password for the user.

	* **Confirm Password:** Enter the password to confirm the value that you entered in the **Password** field. By doing so, you create the password for the user. The user can change the password when first Signing in.

8. Click **Create**. After the user is created, it is listed on the Oracle Machine Learning User Administration page. This completes the task of creating an Oracle Machine Learning user.

This completes the task of signing into Oracle Machine Learning user interface.

## Task 4: Create the CUSTOMERS360 table

In this step, you will create the table ``CUSTOMERS60`` by using the Scratchpad. The Scratchpad is available on the Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks home page. The Scratchpad is a one-click access to a notebook for running SQL statements, PL/SQL scripts, and Python scripts. After you run your scripts, the Scratchpad is automatically saved as a notebook by the default name _Scratchpad_ in the Notebooks page. You can access it later in the Notebooks page. You will learn more about notebooks in Lab 1.

> **Note:** You will be using the table CUSTOMERS360 in the _Using Oracle Machine Learning AutoML UI_ lab and _Using Oracle Machine Learning Services_ lab.

To create the table:

1. On the Oracle Machine Learning home page, click **Scratchpad**.

	![Notebooks option in OML homepage](images/homepage-scratchpad.png)

2. By default, the Scratchpad opens with three paragraphs: `%sql` (to run SQL statements), `%script` (to run PL/SQL scripts), and `%python` (to run Python scripts). Here, you will use the SQL paragraph to run a SQL statement to create the CUSTOMER360 table. On the SQL paragraph, click after the `%sql` tag, and press enter.

	![Create Notebook dialog](images/scratchpad.png)

3. In the SQL paragraph, enter the following script and click the Run icon ![run icon](images/run.png):

    ```
    <copy>
		CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS360 AS
              (SELECT a.CUST_ID, a.CUST_GENDER, a.CUST_MARITAL_STATUS,
                 a.CUST_YEAR_OF_BIRTH, a.CUST_INCOME_LEVEL, a.CUST_CREDIT_LIMIT,
                 b.EDUCATION, b.AFFINITY_CARD,
                 b.HOUSEHOLD_SIZE, b.OCCUPATION, b.YRS_RESIDENCE, b.Y_BOX_GAMES
           FROM SH.CUSTOMERS a, SH.SUPPLEMENTARY_DEMOGRAPHICS b
           WHERE a.CUST_ID = b.CUST_ID);
		</copy>
    ```

	![SQL script to create Customers360 table](images/scratchpad-run.png)

	After the script runs successfully, the paragraph status changes to `FINISHED`, as shown in the screenshot:

	![SQL script to create Customers360 table](images/scratchpad-finished.png)

6. In the next paragraph, edit the paragraph tag to change it to `%sql`, and run the following statement to view the data:

	```
		<copy>
		select * from CUSTOMERS360
			where rownum < 10;
		 </copy>
	 ```

	![Script to view Customers360 table](images/script-view-customers360.png)

This completes the task of creating the CUSTOMERS360 table.
