### Objectives

KEY FEATURES

Non-invasive, real-time transactional data streaming

- Secured, reliable and fault-tolerant data delivery 
- Easy to install, configure and maintain 
- Streams real-time changed data 
- Easily extensible and flexible to stream changed data to other relational targets

KEY BENEFITS

- Improve IT productivity in integrating with data management systems 
- Use real-time data in big data analytics for more timely and reliable insight 
- Improve operations and customer experience with enhanced business insight 
- Minimize overhead on - source systems to maintain high performance

Oracle GoldenGate Classic provides optimized and high performance delivery.

Oracle GoldenGate Classic real-time data streaming platform also allows customers to keep their data reservoirs up to date with their production systems.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- SSH Private Key to access the host via SSH
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Generate SSH Keys
    - Lab: Prepare Setup
    - Lab: Environment Setup
    - Lab: Configure GoldenGate

In this lab we will setup GoldenGate Microservices

## **STEP 1:** Configure Database 

1. Open a terminal session.

````
<copy>sudo su - oracle</copy>
````

2. In the open Terminal Window, start SQL*Plus.

```
<copy>lsnrctl start</copy>
```

```
<copy>sqlplus /as sysdba</copy>
```

```
<copy>startup</copy>
```

3. Enable the database for GoldenGate replication.

```
<copy>alter system set enable_goldengate_replication=true scope=both;</copy>
```

4.	Enable Archive Log on the database.This will require you to shut down the database and restart it.

5. Shutdown the database.

```
<copy>shutdown immediate;</copy>
```

6. Start the database up in mount mode.

```
<copy>startup mount;</copy>
```

7. Change database into Archive Log mode.

```
<copy>alter database archivelog;</copy>
```
![](./images/z5.png " ")

8. Open the database.

```
<copy>alter database open;</copy>
```

9.	Open the Pluggable Database
```
<copy>alter pluggable database all open read write;</copy>
```
10. Enable Minimal Supplemental Logging for the database.  Additionally, enable Force Logging then switch the log file.

```
<copy>alter database add supplemental log data;
alter database force logging;
alter system switch logfile;</copy>
```

## **STEP 2:** Create the GoldenGate users needed at the Container Database and Pluggable Database Layers

1. From SQL*Plus run the following SQL statements to create thcreate e Common User within the Container Database (CDB).

```
<copy> create user c##ggate identified by ggate quota unlimited on USERS account unlock;
grant connect, dba, resource to c##ggate;</copy>
```
```
<copy>begin
SYS.DBMS_GOLDENGATE_AUTH.GRANT_ADMIN_PRIVILEGE('C##GGATE', container=>'ALL');
end;
/</copy>
```

2. From SQL*Plus, run the following SQL statements to create the GoldenGate users for the Pluggable database (PDB)
```
<copy>alter session set container = oggoow19;
grant connect, dba to c##ggate;
create user GGATE identified by ggate quota unlimited on USERS account unlock;
grant connect, dba to ggate;
alter session set container = oggoow191;
grant connect, dba to c##ggate;
create user GGATE identified by ggate quota unlimited on USERS account unlock;
grant connect, dba to ggate;
exit</copy>
```
## Summary
