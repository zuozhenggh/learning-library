# Introduction

This hands-on lab is designed to demonstrate how Oracle GoldenGate 19c Microservices can be used to setup a replication environment by a mix of web page, shell scripts and Rest API interfaces.  All labs will use shell scripts to facilitate the building of the environment, at the same time provide insight into how to use the web pages and AdminClient.

The labs will walk the end-user through how to add all components of Oracle GoldenGate replication.  To do the instantiation of the target database, the end-user will be performing a data pump export and import.  All replication process will be started as they are built.
