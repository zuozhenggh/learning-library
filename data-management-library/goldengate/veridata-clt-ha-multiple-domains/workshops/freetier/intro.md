# Overview                                 

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to use the Oracle GoldenGate Veridata command-line utilities, how to set up the Oracle GoldenGate Veridata Server deployed on the Oracle WebLogic Platform for High Availability, and how to create multiple domains for Oracle GoldenGate Veridata.

## What is Oracle GoldenGate Veridata?
Oracle GoldenGate Veridata compares a source (original, or trusted) set of data with a target (secondary) set of data to identify discrepancies. By accounting for data that is being replicated while a comparison takes place, Oracle GoldenGate Veridata can run concurrently with data transactions and replication, while still producing an accurate comparison report. You can use Oracle GoldenGate Veridata to compare data sets that reside in identical or different types of databases; the workflow is essentially the same for all supported databases, with only very minor differences.


## Workshop Objectives
  - Use the Oracle GoldenGate Veridata Command-Line Utilities, such as Import tool, Export tool, GoldenGate Parameter Processing, and Vericom.
  - Set Up the Oracle GoldenGate Veridata Server on the Oracle WebLogic Platform for High Availability.
  - Create Multiple Domains for Oracle GoldenGate Veridata.
