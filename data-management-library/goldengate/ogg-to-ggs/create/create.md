# Create a Trusted Connection Between Oracle GoldenGate and OCI GoldenGate

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to download the root certificate from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and add it to the Oracle GoldenGate wallet.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes


### Before You Begin

To successfully complete this lab, you must have:

* An on premise or Marketplace Oracle GoldenGate instance running
* The URL and log in credentials for the Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager
* The log in credentials for the OCI GoldenGate Deployment Console

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Download the root certificate for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure from your web browser to your local machine
* Add the certificate to your Oracle GoldenGate wallet
* Create a credential on Oracle GoldenGate to connect to OCI GoldenGate

## **STEP 1A**: Using Chrome to Download the Root Certificate

The following instructions show you how to download the Root Certificate using a Chrome web browser.

1.  Log in to the **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console** with your username and password. See [Signing in to the Console](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/signingin.htm) in the *Oracle Cloud Infrastructure* documentation.

2.  In your Chrome browser address bar, click the padlock icon, and then click **Certificate (Valid)**.
