# Create the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Deployment

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Deployment.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Deployments
A Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployment manages the resources it requires to function. The GoldenGate deployment also lets you access the GoldenGate deployment console, where you can access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console to create and manage Extracts and Replicats.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Locate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate in the Console
* Create a OCI GoldenGate deployment
* Review the OCI GoldenGate deployment details
* Access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you completed all preceding labs.

## **STEP 1:** Create a Deployment

*Note that the compartment names in the screenshots may differ from values that appear in your environment.*

1.  Open the **Navigation Menu**, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and select **GoldenGate**.

9.  Click **Next**.

10. For GoldenGate Instance Name, enter **ogginstance**.

11. For Administrator Username, enter **oggadmin**.

12. For Administrator Password, enter a password. Take note of this password.

13. Click **Create**.

You're brought to the Deployment Details page. It takes a few minutes for the deployment to be created. Its status will change from CREATING to ACTIVE when it is ready for you to use.

## **STEP 2:** Review the Deployment details

On the Deployment Details page, you can:

* Review the deployment's status
* Launch the GoldenGate service deployment console
* Edit the deployment's name or description
* Stop and start the deployment
* Move the deployment to a different compartment
* Review the deployment resource information
* Add tags

## **STEP 3:** Launch the GoldenGate Deployment Console

1. When the deployment is active, click **Launch Console**.

    ![Launch Console](images/04-01-ggs-launchconsole.png)

2. To log in to the GoldenGate deployment console, enter **oggadmin** for User Name and the password you provided above, and then click **Sign In**.

After you log in successfully, you're brought to the GoldenGate deployment console home page. Here, you can access the GoldenGate Administration, Performance Metrics, Distribution, and Receiver Servers, as well as add Extracts and Replicats for your data replication tasks.

In this lab, you created an OCI Deployment and reviewed its Deployment details. You can now proceed to the next [lab](#next).
