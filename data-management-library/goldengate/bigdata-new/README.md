## Oracle Goldengate for Big Data Workshop

Welcome to the Golden Gate for Big Data Workshop. The content will give you a basic understanding of Golden Gate for Big Data and Microservices Architecture.

## Introduction

The GoldenGate for Big Data Workshop is designed to introduce replication capabilities from relational sources to “Big Data” targets, specifically HDFS, Hive, HBase, Kafka and Cassandra. This workshop is based on GoldenGate for Big Data which covers all GG supported Big Data targets, except Flume. Additional targets may be supported using open-source pluggable adapters. For more information, please discuss this with the workshop facilitator or the Data Integration Sales team.

Oracle GoldenGate 21.1 Microservices can be used to setup a replication environment by a mix of web page, shell scripts and Rest API interfaces. All labs will use shell scripts to facilitate the building of the environment, at the same time provide insight into how to use the web pages and AdminClient.
