# Access and Configure ODI Instance

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to access an ODI instance using Apache Guacamole and configure ODI Studio

*Estimated Lab Time*: 30 minutes

### Objectives
* Access an ODI Instance through Apache Guacamole
* Configure ODI Studio
* Import Mappings and Run Initial Load
* Test the Environment

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- SSH Private Key to access the host via SSH
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Generate SSH Keys
    - Lab: Prepare Setup
    - Lab: Environment Setup

## **STEP 0**: Running your Lab
### Access the graphical desktop
For ease of execution of this workshop, your instance has been pre-configured for remote graphical desktop accessible using any modern browser on your laptop or workstation. Proceed as detailed below to login.

1. Launch your browser to the following URL

    ```
    URL: <copy>http://[your instance public-ip address]:8080/guacamole</copy>
    ```

2. Provide login credentials

    ```
    Username: <copy>oracle</copy>
    ```
    ```
    Password: <copy>Guac.LiveLabs_</copy>
    ```

  *Note*: There is an underscore `_` character at the end of the password.

3. To launch *ODI Studio*, *Firefox* browser or a *Terminal* client, click on respective icon on the desktop

### Login to Host using SSH Key based authentication
While all command line tasks included in this workshop can be performed from a terminal session from the remote desktop session as shown above, you can optionally use your preferred SSH client.

Refer to *Lab Environment Setup* for detailed instructions relevant to your SSH client type (e.g. Putty on Windows or Native such as terminal on Mac OS):
  - Authentication OS User - “*opc*”
  - Authentication method - *SSH RSA Key*
  - OS User – “*oracle*”.

1. First login as “*opc*” using your SSH Private Key

2. Then sudo to “*oracle*”. E.g.

    ```
    <copy>sudo su - oracle</copy>
    ```

## **STEP 1:** Launch and Configure ODI Studio

1. A user *Oracle* from the remote desktop session you started above, launch a terminal client and Start the container database, all PDB's and the listener

    ```
    <copy>
    cd ~/scripts/  
    sh ./startup.sh
    </copy>
    ```

  *Note*: You may also run this script from your SSH client if preferred
