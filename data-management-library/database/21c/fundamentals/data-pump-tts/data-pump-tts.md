# Preventing Local Users from Blocking Common Operations - Realms

## Introduction
This lab shows how to parallelize export and import operations for Transportable Tablespace (TTS) metadata.

### About Product/Technology
Until Oracle Database 21c, only the set operator UNION could be combined with ALL. Oracle Database 21c introduces two set operators, MINUS ALL (same as EXCEPT ALL) and INTERSECT ALL.

 ![Set Operators](images/set-operators.png "Set Operators")

- The 1st and 2nd statements use the EXCEPT operator to return only unique rows returned by the 1st query but not the 2nd.  
- The 3rd and 4th statements combine results from two queries using EXCEPT ALL reteruning only rows returned by the 1st query but not the 2nd even if not unique.
- The 5th and 6th statement combines results from 2 queries using INTERSECT ALL returning only unique rows returned by both queries.


Estimated Lab Time: XX minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
* Setup the environment
* Test the set operator with the EXCEPT clause
* Test the set operator with the EXCEPT ALL clause
* Test the set operator with the INTERSECT clause
* Test the set operator with the INTERSECT ALL clause

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
* Lab: SSH Keys
* Lab: Create a VCN
* Lab: Create an OCI VM Database
* Lab: 21c Setup


## **STEP 1:** Prepare the tablespace to be exported

- In `PDB21`, set the tablespace `USERS` to transport to read only. If the tablespace does not exist, create it. IF the master key is not set yet, set it.

```

$ <copy>sqlplus / AS SYSDBA</copy>                   

Connected to:

SQL> <copy> ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT SET KEY IDENTIFIED BY <i>password</i> WITH BACKUP CONTAINER=ALL;</copy>
ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT SET KEY IDENTIFIED BY <i>password</i> WITH BACKUP CONTAINER=ALL
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-46663: master keys not created for all PDBs for REKEY

SQL> <copy>CONNECT sys@PDB21 AS SYSDBA</copy>                   
Enter password: <b><i>password</i></b>
Connected.
SQL> <copy>CREATE TABLESPACE users DATAFILE '/u02/app/oracle/oradata/CDB21/users01.dbf' SIZE 50M;</copy>

Tablespace created.

SQL> <copy>ALTER TABLESPACE users READ ONLY;</copy>

Tablespace altered.

SQL> <copy>EXIT</copy>
$ 

```

## **STEP 2:** Perform the TTS in parallel

- Perform the TTS in parallel against `PDB21`.

```

$ <copy>expdp \"sys@PDB21 AS SYSDBA\" dumpfile=PDB21.dmp TRANSPORT_TABLESPACES=users TRANSPORT_FULL_CHECK=YES LOGFILE=tts.log REUSE_DUMPFILES=YES PARALLEL=2</copy>

$ 

```

## **STEP 3:** Set the tablespace back to read write

- Use the `ALTER TABLESPACE` command to set the tablespace back to read write.

```

$ <copy>sqlplus sys@PDB21 AS SYSDBA</copy>                   

Copyright (c) 1982, 2019, Oracle.  All rights reserved.

Enter password: <b><i>password</i></b>

Connected to:

SQL> <copy>ALTER TABLESPACE users READ WRITE;</copy>

Tablespace altered.

SQL> <copy>EXIT</copy>
$ 

```
