# Synchronizing Multiple Applications In Application PDBs

## Introduction
This lab shows how to reduce the number of synchronization statements when you have to synchronize multiple applications in application PDBs. In previous Oracle Database versions, you had to execute as many synchronization statements as applications.

### About Product/Technology
Until Oracle Database 21c, only the set operator UNION could be combined with ALL. Oracle Database 21c introduces two set operators, MINUS ALL (same as EXCEPT ALL) and INTERSECT ALL.

 ![Set Operators](images/set-operators.png "Set Operators")

- The 1st and 2nd statements use the EXCEPT operator to return only unique rows returned by the 1st query but not the 2nd.  
- The 3rd and 4th statements combine results from two queries using EXCEPT ALL reteruning only rows returned by the 1st query but not the 2nd even if not unique.
- The 5th and 6th statement combines results from 2 queries using INTERSECT ALL returning only unique rows returned by both queries.


Estimated Lab Time: XX minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
* Setup the environment
* Test the set operator with the EXCEPT clause
* Test the set operator with the EXCEPT ALL clause
* Test the set operator with the INTERSECT clause
* Test the set operator with the INTERSECT ALL clause

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
* Lab: SSH Keys
* Lab: Create a VCN
* Lab: Create an OCI VM Database
* Lab: 21c Setup


## **STEP 1:** Set up the environment

- Install the `TOYS_APP` and the `SALES_TOYS_APP` applications in the `TOYS_ROOT` application container for both `ROBOTS` and `DOLLS` application PDBs. The script defines the application container, installs the two applications in the application container, and finally creates the two application PDBs in the application container.

    
    - To be able to connect during the shell script execution to `TOYS_ROOT`, `ROBOTS` and `DOLLS`, create the entries in the `tnsnames.ora` file as explained in [practices environment](https://docs-uat.us.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/ftnew/practices-environment1.html#GUID-467FB8FF-C8CC-48A0-B39A-5F7E7B9A9CF8__GUID-08108F3C-C78A-45B7-8452-6985DF9EF1DD).

    - Execute the shell script.

    ```
    
    $ <copy>cd /home/oracle/labs/M104780GC10</copy>
    $ <copy>/home/oracle/labs/M104780GC10/setup_apps.sh</copy>
    SQL> host mkdir /u01/app/oracle/admin/CDB21/tde
    mkdir: cannot create directory '/u01/app/oracle/admin/CDB21/tde': File exists
    
    SQL>
    SQL> ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT SET KEYSTORE CLOSE CONTAINER=ALL ;
    ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT SET KEYSTORE CLOSE CONTAINER=ALL
    *
    ERROR at line 1:
    ORA-28389: cannot close auto login wallet
    
    SQL> ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT SET KEYSTORE CLOSE IDENTIFIED BY <i>password</i> CONTAINER=ALL;
    
    keystore altered.
    ...
    SQL> ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE toys_root CLOSE IMMEDIATE;
    
    Pluggable database altered.
    
    SQL> DROP PLUGGABLE DATABASE robots INCLUDING DATAFILES;
    
    Pluggable database dropped.
    
    SQL> DROP PLUGGABLE DATABASE dolls INCLUDING DATAFILES;
    
    Pluggable database dropped.
    
    SQL> DROP PLUGGABLE DATABASE toys_root INCLUDING DATAFILES;
    
    Pluggable database dropped.
    
    SQL> ALTER SESSION SET db_create_file_dest='/home/oracle/labs/toys_root';
    
    Session altered.
    
    SQL> CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE toys_root AS APPLICATION CONTAINER
      2    ADMIN USER admin IDENTIFIED BY <i>password</i> ROLES=(CONNECT);
    
    Pluggable database created.
    
    ...
    
    SQL> alter pluggable database dolls open;
    
    Pluggable database altered.
    
    SQL>
    SQL> exit
    $
    
    ```

  
  

## **STEP 2:** Display the applications installed

```

$ <copy>sqlplus / AS SYSDBA</copy>

Connected to:

SQL> <copy>COL app_name FORMAT A16</copy>
SQL> <copy>COL app_version FORMAT A12</copy>
SQL> <copy>COL pdb_name FORMAT A10</copy>
SQL> <copy>SELECT app_name, app_version, app_status, p.pdb_name
     FROM   cdb_applications a, cdb_pdbs p
     WHERE  a.con_id = p.pdb_id
     AND    app_name NOT LIKE '%APP$%'
     ORDER BY 1;</copy>

APP_NAME         APP_VERSION  APP_STATUS   PDB_NAME
---------------- ------------ ------------ ----------
SALES_TOYS_APP   1.0          NORMAL       TOYS_ROOT
TOYS_APP         1.0          NORMAL       TOYS_ROOT

SQL>

```
Observe that the applications `toys_app` and `sales_toys_app` are installed in the application container at version 1.0.

## **STEP 3:** Synchronize the application PDBs

- Synchronize the application PDBs with the new applications `toys_app` and `sales_toys_app` installed.

  
  ```
  
  SQL> <copy>CONNECT sys@robots AS SYSDBA</copy>
  
  Enter password: <b><i>password</i></b>
  
  SQL> <copy>ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE APPLICATION toys_app, sales_toys_app SYNC;</copy>
  
  Pluggable database altered.
  
  SQL>
  
  ```

- Display the applications installed in the application container.

  
  ```
  
  SQL> <copy>SELECT app_name, app_version, app_status, p.pdb_name
  
       FROM   cdb_applications a, cdb_pdbs p
  
       WHERE  a.con_id = p.pdb_id
  
       AND    app_name NOT LIKE '%APP$%'
  
       ORDER BY 1;</copy>
  
  APP_NAME         APP_VERSION  APP_STATUS   PDB_NAME
  
  ---------------- ------------ ------------ ----------

  TOYS_APP         1.0          NORMAL       ROBOTS
  
  SQL> <copy>CONNECT sys@dolls AS SYSDBA</copy>
  
  Enter password: <b><i>password</i></b>
  
  SQL> <copy>ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE APPLICATION toys_app, sales_toys_app SYNC;</copy>
  
  Pluggable database altered.
  
  SQL> <copy>SELECT app_name, app_version, app_status, p.pdb_name
  
       FROM   cdb_applications a, cdb_pdbs p
  
       WHERE  a.con_id = p.pdb_id
  
       AND    app_name NOT LIKE '%APP$%'
  
       ORDER BY 1;</copy>
  
  APP_NAME         APP_VERSION  APP_STATUS   PDB_NAME
  
  ---------------- ------------ ------------ ----------
  
  SALES_TOYS_APP   1.0          NORMAL       DOLLS
  
  TOYS_APP         1.0          NORMAL       DOLLS
  
  SQL> <copy>CONNECT / AS SYSDBA</copy>
  
  Connected.
  
  SQL> <copy>SELECT app_name, app_version, app_status, p.pdb_name
  
       FROM   cdb_applications a, cdb_pdbs p
  
       WHERE  a.con_id = p.pdb_id
  
       AND    app_name NOT LIKE '%APP$%'
  
       ORDER BY 1;</copy>  
  
  APP_NAME         APP_VERSION  APP_STATUS   PDB_NAME
  
  ---------------- ------------ ------------ ----------
  
  SALES_TOYS_APP   1.0          NORMAL       DOLLS
  
  SALES_TOYS_APP   1.0          NORMAL       ROBOTS
  
  SALES_TOYS_APP   1.0          NORMAL       TOYS_ROOT
  
  TOYS_APP         1.0          NORMAL       DOLLS
  
  TOYS_APP         1.0          NORMAL       TOYS_ROOT
  
  TOYS_APP         1.0          NORMAL       ROBOTS
