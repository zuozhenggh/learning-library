# New Set Operators

## Introduction
This lab shows how to use the new set operators, EXCEPT, EXCEPT ALL and INTERSECT ALL.

### About Product/Technology
Until Oracle Database 21c, only the set operator UNION could be combined with ALL. Oracle Database 21c introduces two set operators, MINUS ALL (same as EXCEPT ALL) and INTERSECT ALL.

 ![Set Operators](images/set-operators.png "Set Operators")

- The 1st and 2nd statements use the EXCEPT operator to return only unique rows returned by the 1st query but not the 2nd.  
- The 3rd and 4th statements combine results from two queries using EXCEPT ALL reteruning only rows returned by the 1st query but not the 2nd even if not unique.
- The 5th and 6th statement combines results from 2 queries using INTERSECT ALL returning only unique rows returned by both queries.


Estimated Lab Time: XX minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
* Setup the environment
* Test the set operator with the EXCEPT clause
* Test the set operator with the EXCEPT ALL clause
* Test the set operator with the INTERSECT clause
* Test the set operator with the INTERSECT ALL clause

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account


## **STEP  1**: Set up the environment

In this step you will execute the `/home/oracle/labs/M104783GC10/setup_oe_tables.sh` shell script. The shell script creates and loads the `OE.INVENTORIES`, `OE.ORDERS` and `OE.ORDER_ITEMS` tables.

1.  Change to the lab directory and run the shell script to setup the tables
  ```
  
  $ <copy>cd /home/oracle/labs/M104783GC10</copy>
  
  $ <copy>/home/oracle/labs/M104783GC10/setup_oe_tables.sh</copy>
  
  ...
  
  Commit complete.

  Version 21.2.0.0.0
  
  $ 
  
  ```

## **STEP  2**: Test the set operator with the `EXCEPT` clause

- Connect to `PDB21` as `OE`.

  
  ```
  
  $ <copy>sqlplus oe@PDB21</copy>

  SQL>
  
  ```

- Count in both tables, `INVENTORIES` and `ORDER_ITEMS`, respectively the number of products available in the inventory and the number of products that customers ordered.

  
  ```
  
  SQL> <copy>SELECT count(distinct product_id) FROM inventories;</copy>
  
  COUNT(PRODUCT_ID)
  
  -----------------
  
                208
  
  SQL> <copy>SELECT count(distinct product_id) FROM order_items;</copy>
  
  COUNT(PRODUCT_ID)
  
  -----------------
  
                185
  
  SQL>
  
  ```

- How many products are in the inventory that were never ordered? Use the `EXCEPT` operator to retrieve only unique rows returned by the first query but not by the second.

  
  ```
  
  SQL> <copy>SELECT count(*) FROM 
  
         (SELECT product_id FROM inventories
  
           EXCEPT
  
          SELECT product_id FROM order_items);</copy>
  
    COUNT(*)
  
  ----------
  
          84
  
  SQL>
  
  ```

- How many products were ordered that are now missing in the inventory? The order of the queries is relevant for the result.

  
  ```
  
  SQL> <copy>SELECT count(*) FROM 
  
         (SELECT product_id FROM order_items
  
            EXCEPT
  
          SELECT product_id FROM inventories);</copy>
  
    COUNT(*)
  
  ----------
  
          61
  
  SQL>
  
  ```

## **STEP  3**: Test the set operator with the `EXCEPT ALL` clause

- Would the usage of ALL in the set operator defined in a query in a previous step mean anything?

```

SQL> <copy>SELECT product_id FROM inventories
          EXCEPT ALL
        SELECT product_id FROM order_items;</copy>

PRODUCT_ID
----------
      1729
      1729
      1729
      1729
      1729
      1729
      1733
      1733
      1733
      1733
      1733
      1733
      1733
      1733
      1733
...
      3502
      3502
      3502
      3502
      3502
      3503
      3503
      3503
      3503
      3503

826 rows selected.

SQL> <copy>SELECT count(*) FROM 
       (SELECT product_id FROM inventories
          EXCEPT ALL
        SELECT product_id FROM order_items);</copy>

  COUNT(*)
----------
       826

SQL>

```
The result shows all rows in the `INVENTORIES` table that contain products that were never ordered all inventories. This does not mean anything relevant. The use of `ALL` in operators must be appropriate.

## **STEP  4**: Test the set operator with the `INTERSECT` clause

- How many products that were ordered are still orderable? The statement combining the results from two queries with the `INTERSECT` operator returns only those unique rows returned by both queries.

```

SQL> <copy>SELECT count(*) FROM 
       (SELECT product_id FROM inventories
           INTERSECT
        SELECT product_id FROM order_items);</copy>

  COUNT(*)
----------
       124

SQL> <copy>SELECT count(*) FROM 
       (SELECT product_id FROM order_items
           INTERSECT
        SELECT product_id FROM inventories);</copy>

  COUNT(*)
----------
       124

SQL>

```

## **STEP  5 **: Test the set operator with the `INTERSECT ALL` clause

- Would the usage of `ALL` in the operator defined in the query in step 8 mean anything?

```

SQL> <copy>SELECT count(*) FROM 
       (SELECT product_id FROM order_items
           INTERSECT ALL
        SELECT product_id FROM inventories);</copy>

  COUNT(*)
----------
       286

SQL> <copy>EXIT</copy>
$

```
The result shows all rows in the `INVENTORIES` table that contain products that were ordered. This does not mean that these products were ordered from these warehouses. The query does not mean anything relevant. The use of `ALL` in operators must be appropriate.
