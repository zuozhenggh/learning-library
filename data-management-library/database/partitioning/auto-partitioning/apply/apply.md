# Create the Recommended Partitioned Table

## Introduction

Use automatic indexing to partition the candidate table.

Estimated Time: 10mins

### Objectives
- Accept the partitioning recommendation and create the partitioned table.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:

- Provision an ADB instance (19c, Always Free)
- Create non-partitioned table
- Validate the table
- Execute recommend task

## Task 1: Apply the Recommendation to Initiate Partitioning

In the previous lab, the PL/SQL procedure displayed a recommendation ID similar to this example:

`````
=============================================
ID:     D28FC3CF09DF1E1DE053D010000AF8F8
Method: LIST(SYS_OP_INTERVAL_HIGH_BOUND("D", INTERVAL '2' MONTH, TIMESTAMP '2020-01-01 00:00:00')) AUTOMATIC 
Key   : D
=============================================
`````

The "ID" is a *recommendation ID*, and is used to identify which recommendation you want to apply. It is displayed at the top of the recommendation report too.

1. Execute the following command to initiate the partitioned table build, using your recomendation ID:

    ````
    <copy>
       exec dbms_auto_partition.apply_recommendation('<your recommendation ID>');
    </copy>
    ````
    For example:

    ````
    exec dbms_auto_partition.apply_recommendation('D28FC3CF09DF1E1DE053D010000AF8F8');
    ````


A partitioned version of the table will be build on-line using an ALTER TABLE MODIFY PARTITION ONLINE command. It will take approximately 10 minutes for a 5GB table in a 19c Always Free instance.

## Task 2: Confirm that the Table Has Been Partitioned

1. Check that APART is now partitioned:

    ````
    <copy>
    set trims on
    set linesize 300
    column partition_name format a20
    column segment_name format a15
    
    select segment_name,
           partition_name,
           segment_type,
           bytes/(1024*1024) mb
    from   user_segments
    order by partition_name;
    </copy>
    ````

    `````
    SEGMENT_NAME  PARTITION_NAME       SEGMENT_TYPE               MB
    ------------- -------------------- ------------------ ----------
    APART         P_NULL               TABLE PARTITION         .0625
    APART         SYS_P1576            TABLE PARTITION           936
    APART         SYS_P1577            TABLE PARTITION           952
    APART         SYS_P1578            TABLE PARTITION           952
    APART         SYS_P1579            TABLE PARTITION           968
    APART         SYS_P1580            TABLE PARTITION           952
    APART         SYS_P1581            TABLE PARTITION           816
    `````

The table has a total of seven partitions, each approximately 9MB in size except for a partition intended to receive NULL partition keys. The partition sizes vary because compression factors are very sensitive to data content and data ordering.

This concludes the workshop.
