# Failover and Reinstate

## Introduction
A failover is an unplanned event that assumes the primary database is lost. The standby database is converted to a primary database immediately. A failover might result in some data loss when you use **Maximum Performance** protection mode. After a failover the old primary database must be reinstated as a physical standby which is made simpler with flashback database and Data Guard broker enabled. 

Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes.

### Objectives
- Setup the current primary database flashback on.
- Failover.
- Reinstate the previous primary database.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have already completed the following labs:

- Deploy Active Data Guard
- Test with Active Data Guard

## **STEP 1:** Setup the current primary database flashback on

In the previous lab, you have done the Data Guard switch over. Now, the current primary database is the **ORCLSTBY** and the current standby database is the **ORCL**.

1. From the current primary side. Check the flashback status of the current primary database

    ```
    [oracle@standby ~]$ sqlplus / as sysdba

    -------------------- ---------------- ------------------
    READ WRITE	     PRIMARY	      NO
    
    SQL> 
    ```

2. If the flashback is not enabled you need to setup database flashback on, otherwise you won't be able to reinstate the primary after the failover.

    ```
    SQL> shutdown immediate;

    Database dismounted.

    SQL> startup mount;

    ```

## **STEP 2:** Failover

1. Connect with DGMGRL, validate the primary and standby database

    ```
    [oracle@standby ~]$ dgmgrl sys/Ora_DB4U@orcl
    DGMGRL for Linux: Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production on Wed Feb 5 05:41:24 2020

    Welcome to DGMGRL, type "help" for information.
    Connected to "ORCL"
    Connected as SYSDBA.
    DGMGRL> show configuration
    
    Configuration - adgconfig
    
      Protection Mode: MaxPerformance
      Members:
      orclstby - Primary database
        orcl     - Physical standby database

        Validating static connect identifier for the primary database orclstby...
        The static connect identifier allows for a connection to database "orclstby".
    
    DGMGRL> validate database orcl
    
      Database Role:     Physical standby database
      Primary Database:  orclstby

        orcl    :  On
    
      Managed by Clusterware:

        The static connect identifier allows for a connection to database "orclstby".

        orcl Online Redo Log Files:       Not Cleared
        orcl Standby Redo Log Files:      Available
    
    DGMGRL> 
    ```

2. Failover to current standby.

    ```
    DGMGRL> failover to orcl
    Performing failover NOW, please wait...
    Failover succeeded, new primary is "orcl"
    DGMGRL> show configuration
    
    Configuration - adgconfig
    
      Protection Mode: MaxPerformance
      Members:
      orcl     - Primary database
        orclstby - Physical standby database (disabled)
          ORA-16661: the standby database needs to be reinstated
    
    Fast-Start Failover:  Disabled
    
    Configuration Status:
    SUCCESS   (status updated 114 seconds ago)
    
    DGMGRL> 
    ```

Now, the primary is the back to the **ORCL** database, and the standby database is disabled, which needs to be reinstated.

## **STEP 3:** Reinstate the previous primary database

1. Connect  to the current standby database, shutdown the database and startup mount before reinstating. 

    ```
    DGMGRL> <copy>connect sys/Ora_DB4U@orclstby</copy>
    Connected to "ORCLSTBY"
    Connected as SYSDBA.
    DGMGRL> <copy>shutdown immediate</copy>
    Database closed.
    Database dismounted.
    ORACLE instance shut down.
    Connected to an idle instance.
    DGMGRL> <copy>startup mount</copy>
    Connected to "ORCLSTBY"
    ORACLE instance started.
    Database mounted.
    DGMGRL>   
    ```

2. Connect to the new primary side, reinstate the standby database.

    ```
    DGMGRL> <copy>connect sys/Ora_DB4U@orcl</copy>
    Connected to "ORCL"
    Connected as SYSDBA.
    DGMGRL> reinstate database orclstby
    Reinstating database "orclstby", please wait...
    Reinstatement of database "orclstby" succeeded
    DGMGRL> <copy>show configuration</copy>
    
    Configuration - adgconfig
    
      Protection Mode: MaxPerformance
      Members:
      orcl        - Primary database
        orclstby - Physical standby database 
    
    Fast-Start Failover:  Disabled
    
    Configuration Status:
    SUCCESS   (status updated 21 seconds ago)
    
    DGMGRL>
    ```
If you encounter the Warning: ORA-16809: multiple warnings detected for the member or Warning: ORA-16854: apply lag could not be determined. Wait some time and show configuration again.

3. Check the status of the new standby database

    ```
    [oracle@standby ~]$ sqlplus / as sysdba
    
    SQL*Plus: Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production on Wed Feb 5 05:53:48 2020

    Version 19.10.0.0.0
    
    SQL> select open_mode,database_role from v$database;
    
    OPEN_MODE	     DATABASE_ROLE
    -------------------- ----------------
    READ ONLY WITH APPLY PHYSICAL STANDBY
    
    SQL> 
    ```
