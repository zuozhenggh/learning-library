# Create your primary database with the Oracle Database Cloud Service.

Prerequisite

- VCN with private subnet

The Oracle Database Cloud Service automates the provisioning and management of the Oracle database in the cloud.  We will create the Oracle Database Cloud Service as the primary database in one of the cloud regions.

1. Select a region for your primary database.
2. Select the menu Oracle Databases then Bare Metal, VM, and Exadata.
3. Select your compartment.

5. Ensure your compartment is selected.
6. Enter a name for your database for the UI display.
7. If you have more than one availability domain, select any one.


For the lab we will use a virtual machine with only one core.  

Data Guard supports RAC databases, but we'll use a single instance database in the lab.  

Standard Edition does not support Data Guard, select the other editions.
