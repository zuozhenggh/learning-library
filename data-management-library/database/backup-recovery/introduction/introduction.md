# Introduction

## Oracle Database Backup Service

Oracle Database Backup Service (ODBS) is a backup-as-a-service offering that enables customers to store their backups securely in the Oracle cloud. ODBS provides a transparent, scalable, efficient, and elastic cloud storage platform for Oracle database backups. The client side Oracle Database Cloud Backup Module which is used with Recovery Manager (RMAN) transparently handles the backup and restore operations.

In this workshop, you will learn how to backup and recover your on-premise database to the OCI.

Estimated Lab Time: 2 hours

### Objectives

- Install the Oracle Database Cloud Backup Module onto the VM image provided in the workshop. The database provided is used as our “On-Premise” example.

- Configure RMAN to support the Oracle Database Cloud Backup Module. Then, backup the database and take a restore point to be used for Point-In-Time-Recovery.

- Do a destructive operation to the database and then Restore and Recover to a specific Point-In-Time.

### Prerequisites

- An on-premise database version 11.2.0.4 or later
