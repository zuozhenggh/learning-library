# Access Your Environment

## Introduction
This lab shows you how to access your `workshop-staged` and `workshop-installed` compute instances in the LiveLabs tenancy. Both compute instances have a noVNC desktop, which provides an easy-to-use graphical interface.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Connect to your `workshop-staged` compute instance
- Connect to your `workshop-installed` compute instance

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
- Successfully submitted a reservation using the **Reserve Workshop on LiveLabs** option
- Obtained two URLs from LiveLabs to access your provisioned compute instances

## Task 1: Connect to your `workshop-staged` compute instance

1. In LiveLabs, navigate to **My Reservations**.

2. In the list, find the request that you submitted. Only one item is displayed if this is your first request.

3. Click **Launch Workshop**.

4. Click the **workshop-staged** link. A browser is opened and you are automatically signed in to the `workshop-staged` compute instance as the `oracle` user.

    While rare, you may see an error titled *Deceptive Site Ahead* or similar, depending on your browser type as shown below. Public IP addresses used for LiveLabs provisioning comes from a pool of reusable addresses, and this error is due to the fact that the address was previously used by a compute instance long terminated, but that wasn't properly secured, got compromised and was flagged. You can safely ignore the error and proceed by clicking on **Details**, and finally on **Visit this unsafe site**.

## Task 2: Connect to your `workshop-staged` compute instance

1. Return to **My Reservations** in LiveLabs.

2. Find the request that you submitted from the list.

3. Click **Launch Workshop**.

4. Click the **workshop-installed** link. A browser is opened and you are automatically signed in to the `workshop-installed` compute instance as the `oracle` user.

**This concludes this lab. Please proceed to the next lab in the Contents menu.**
