# Oracle Database On Docker

## Lab Introduction 
Welcome to Oracle Database on Docker workshop. Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
