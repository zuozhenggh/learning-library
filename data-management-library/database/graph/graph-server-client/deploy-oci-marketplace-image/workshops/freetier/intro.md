# Workshop Introduction and Overview                                    

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to  deploy, configure, and use the Graph Server and Client package to query, analyze, and visualize graph content stored in a Free Tier Autonomous Database (ADB) instance. You will provision a new free tier ADB instance, load data into it, create a graph, and then query, analyze and visualize the graph.


## What is Oracle Property Graph?
Oracle Database property graph supports and consists of graph storage, indexing, and search; a powerful in-memory analyst with 50 built-in, parallel analytic functions; a graph query language and developer APIs. Graph algorithms enable you to explore and discover relationships in social networks, IoT, big data, data warehouses and complex transaction data for applications such as fraud detection in banking, customer 360, and smart manufacturing.
