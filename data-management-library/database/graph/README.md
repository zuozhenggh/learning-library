# Oracle Database Graph Github

## Oracle as a Property Graph
As part of the Converged Oracle Database, you have a scalable property graph database; a powerful in-memory analyst with 50 built-in, parallel analytic functions; and a graph query language and developer APIs. Graph algorithms enable you to explore and discover relationships in social networks, IoT, big data, data warehouses and complex transaction data for applications such as fraud detection in banking, customer 360, and smart manufacturing.
