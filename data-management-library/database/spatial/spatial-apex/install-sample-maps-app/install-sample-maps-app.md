## Task 2: Load Data

1. You are now in the Sample Maps application which provides numerous examples of maps and spatial operations in APEX. On initial launch a warning message is displayed regarding data loading. Click on the **Data Loading** link within that message. You will navigate to a page where you complete loading of demo data.

2. The Data Loading page shows the loading status of the States and Airports datasets used by the Sample Maps applocation and the rest of this workshop. Upon installation of the Sample Maps application, these datasets are only partially loaded. To complete the sample data loading, you may either load directly from files stored in github, or you may first download the files and load from your local system. In this case, you will load directly from github. 
   
   Click on the link to load **Directly from GitHub** and then click **Load Dataset** at the top right.
