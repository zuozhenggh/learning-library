## Introduction
This lab will show you how to login to the cloud and setup your environment using Oracle Resource Manager.  Once the environment setup is complete, you will proceed to the Multitenant lab.


## Lab Assumptions
- Each participant has been sent two emails, one from Oracle Cloud  with their username and another from the Database PM gmail account with their temporary password.

## Lab Settings
- **Tenancy**:  c4u03
- **Username/Password**:  Sent via email
- **Compartment**: \<Provided by Oracle\>
- **VCN**: \<Provided by Oracle\>
- **Region**: \<Provided by Oracle\>


## Section 1-Login to the Oracle Cloud
1.  You should have received two emails.  **Email 1:**  From noreply with the subject **Verify Email Request** (check your spam and junk folders).  This has the link that verifies your email.  Without clicking on this link you cannot login to the tenancy.  Open up this email.  Click on the **Sign In to Oracle Cloud** link.

2.  You should have received a 2nd email with your temporary password.  Enter your username and your password (Email 2).  You will then be taken to a screen to change your password.  Choose a new password that you can remember and click **Sign In**

    ![](img/changepwd.png)


3. Once you successfully login, you will be presented with the Oracle Cloud homepage. If you get an *Email Activation Unsuccessful* message, check to see if you can still access the cloud by looking for the hamburger menu to the left.

## Section 2-Generate an SSH Key Pair

If you already have an ssh key pair, you may use that to connect to your environment.  Based on your laptop config, choose the appropriate step to connect to your instance.

### For MAC Users ### 

1.  Open up a terminal and type the following commands.  When prompted for a passphrase click **enter**. *Do not enter a passphrase*.
     ````
    cd ~
    cd .ssh
    ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f optionskey
    ````

    ![](img/sshkeygen.png) 
3.  Inspect your .ssh directory.  You should see two files.  optionskey and optionskey.pub.  Copy the contents of the pub file `optionskey.pub` into notepad.  Your key file should be one line. You will need this to access your instance later.  

    ````
    ls -l .ssh
    more optionskey.pub
    ````


### For Windows: Using GitBash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) ### 

1. Open the terminal tool of your choice
2. Type the following command at the prompt to generate keys for your instance.
    ````
    ssh-keygen -f optionskey
    ````
3. Press enter to accept the default values
4. Do not assign a password for this exercise. (note you should always assign an SSH key password in production)
5. Type the following to retrieve your public key.  You will need this to access your instance in Section 5.  
    ````
    cat ~/.ssh/optionskey.pub 
    ````



### For Windows: Using PuttyGen ### 

1. Open PuttyGen
2. Click the [Generate] button

    ![](img/puttygen-generate.jpg) 
3. Move your mouse around the screen randomly until the progress bar reaches 100%
4. Click the [Save private key] button. Name the file `optionskey`.  This file will not have an extension.

    ![](img/puttygen-saveprivatekey.jpg) 
5. Save the public key (displayed in the text field) by copying it to the clipboard and saving it manually to a new text file. Name the file `optionskey.pub`.   You will need this to access your instance in Section 5.  

6. Note: Sometimes PuttyGen does not save the public key in the correct format. The text string displayed in the window is correct so copy/paste to be sure.

    Enter the following inforamtion. Some information may already be pre-populated.  Do not change the pre-populated info.  You will be updating Public Subnet, Display Name, AD (Availbility Domain) and SSH Key.

    **Public Subnet ID**:  Enter the subnet ID based on your region.   The subnets are provided in Email 2

    **Display Name:** Enter your firstname and lastname and the day you were born (do not enter any special characters here, including periods, it may mess up the configuration)
    
    **AD**: Enter 1, 2, or 3 based on your last name.  (A-J -> 1, K - M -> 2, N-Z -> 3)
    
    **SSH Public Key**:  Paste the public key you created in the earlier step (it should be one line)

8. Click **Next**.

## Section 5b-Run the Setup Scripts

1.  Copy the following commands into your terminal.  This script takes approximately 1.5hrs to run.  It is a series of scripts that create several databases in multiple ORACLE HOMES so that you can run both the Multitenant and Advanced Multitenant labs.  The scripts are run in the background so you should be able to exit out while it's running.  The envprep.sh takes approximately 30 minutes and createCDBs.sh takes 60 minutes.  

    Note: If you are running in windows using putty, ensure your Session Timeout is set to greater than 0

    ````
    cd /home/opc/
    wget https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/8O0AbribZ9s0lxMh75PBzqRtGjjcHeEjqM-OAUFjOkM/n/c4u03/b/labfiles/o/labs.zip
    sudo mv labs.zip /home/oracle
    sudo chown oracle:oinstall /home/oracle/labs.zip 
    sudo su - oracle
    unzip labs.zip
    cd /home/oracle/labs
    exit
    sudo su - 
    nohup /home/oracle/labs/envprep.sh &> /home/oracle/labs/nohupenvprep.out&
    sudo su - oracle
    cd /home/oracle/labs
    nohup /home/oracle/labs/multitenant/createCDBs.sh &> nohupmultitenant.out&
    ````

2.   To check on the progress of this set of scripts, enter the command below.  This script takes about 90 minutes to complete.

        ````
        tail -f /home/oracle/labs/nohupenvprep.out
        tail -f /home/oracle/labs/nohupmultitenant.out

        ````

3.  Once the script is finished,        
Congratulations!  Now you have the environment to run the Multitenant labs.   You may proceed to the [Multitenant Lab](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/database/options/multitenant.html).
