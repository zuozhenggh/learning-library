# Create an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure VM Database Workshop
## Introduction

Welcome to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure VM Database Workshop. Oracle Cloud offers 1-node database systems on bare metal or virtual machines. In this workshop, you'll build an Oracle Database instance on a Virtual Machine. This approach is useful when you want a quick way to spin up an Oracle Database instance.
This workshop will walk you through the following tasks:

- Sign up for an Oracle Free Trial account and sign in to your account
- Create a set of SSH keys
- Create a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) instance
- Create a Virtual Machine Database instance and connect to it using SSH

Optional Labs:
- Add an Ingress Rule to an existing Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) instance
- Connect to a Virtual Machine Database instance using SQL Developer

Each of the labs are 5 -10 minutes in length, so you'll be up and running in no time.

*Note: You will need a Free Trial or Paid account for this workshop (not Always Free services)*

### **Let's Get Started!**
