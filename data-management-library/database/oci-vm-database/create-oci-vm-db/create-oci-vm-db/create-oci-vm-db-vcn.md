# Create a 21C VM Database

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create a virtual cloud network (VCN) and an instance of an Oracle 21c Database running in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides several options for rapidly creating a Database system for development and testing, including fast provisioning of 1-node virtual machine database systems.

A virtual cloud network (VCN) provides the necessary network Infrastructure required to support resources, including Oracle Database instances. This includes a gateway, route tables, security lists, DNS and so on. 

### Objectives
You can use a 1-node virtual database system to complete labs and tutorials that require an Oracle database.

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
* SSH Keys
  
## **STEP 1**: Create a Virtual Cloud Network instance
Fortunately, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides a wizard that simplifies the creation of a basic, public internet accessible VCN.

1. Login to Oracle Cloud
2. From the Console menu, select **Networking > Virtual Cloud Networks**.

  ![](../create-virtual-cloud-network/images/virtual-cloud-networks.png " ")

2. Select your compartment and click on **Start VCN Wizard**. If you haven't created any compartments yet, just leave it as the default (root) compartment.

3. Be sure the default "VCN with Internet Connectivity" is selected and click **Start VCN Wizard**.

4. Enter a name for your VCN, and enter the default values for the VCN CIDR block(10.0.0.0/16), Public Subnet CIDR block (10.0.0.0/24) and Private CIDR block (10.0.1.0/24), and click **Next**.

5. Review your selections on the next screen and click **Create**.

6. On the summary screen, click **View Virtual Cloud Network**.
   
## **STEP 2**: Create a Database Virtual Machine

1. From the Console menu, click on **Bare Metal, VM, and Exadata**.

2. Select the compartment you want to create the database in and click on **Create DB System**.

3. On the DB System Information form, enter the following information and click **Next**:

    * In the **Name your DB system** field, give your database a name.
    * Select an availability domain.
    * Select a **Virtual Machine** as your shape type.
    * Select a **shape** *VM Standard2.4*
    * Configure the DB system, set **Node count** to *1* and **Software edition** to *EE High Performance*
    * Select *Logical Volume Manager* as the **Storage Management Software**. *Note:  This is **very** important to choose Logical Volume Manager*
    * Accept the default of *256* to **Available Storage**
    * In the **Add public SSH keys** section, browse to the location of your SSH keys and select the public key file (with a .pub extension). *Note:  Ensure you paste a one line file if using Cloud Shell*
    * In the **Specify the Network information** section, select the VCN you created using the drop down list.
    * Select the *public subnet* using the drop down list.
    * Enter a hostname prefix. *Note: Hostname should start with a letter*

4. On the Database Information form, enter the following information and click **Create DB System**.

    * In the **Database name** field, change the default database name to "cdb1".
    * On the **Database version** select the version of the Oracle Database you want: 21c by clicking the **Change Database Image** button
    * In the **PDB name** field, enter "pdb1".
    * Enter the password: `WElcome123##` for your sys user in the **Password** field and then repeat the password in the **Confirm password** field.  This password will be used for all exercises in the 21c workshop series.  Please enter it carefully.

5. After a few minutes, your Database System will change color from yellow (Provisioning) to green.

## **STEP 3**: Connect to the Database using SSH

1. On the **DB System Details** page, Click **Nodes**.

  ![](images/VM-DB-IP.png " ")

   Note the IP address.

2. In Cloud Shell or your terminal window, navigate to the folder where you created the SSH keys and enter this command, using your IP address:

    ```
    $ <copy>ssh -i ./myOracleCloudKey opc@</copy>123.123.123.123
    Enter passphrase for key './myOracleCloudKey':
    Last login: Tue Feb  4 15:21:57 2020 from 123.123.123.123
    [opc@tmdb1 ~]$
    ```

3. Once connected, you can switch to the "oracle" OS user and connect using SQL*Plus:

    ```
    [opc@tmdb1 ~]$ sudo su - oracle
    [oracle@tmdb1 ~]$ . oraenv
    ORACLE_SID = [cdb1] ?
    The Oracle base has been set to /u01/app/oracle
    [oracle@tmdb1 ~]$ sqlplus / as sysdba

    SQL*Plus: Release 21.0.0.0.0 - Production on Sat Nov 15 14:01:48 2020
    Version 21.2.0.0.0

    Copyright (c) 1982, 2020, Oracle.  All rights reserved.

    Connected to:
    Oracle Database 21c EE High Perf Release 21.0.0.0.0 - Production
    Version 21.0.0.0.0

    SQL>
    ```

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
