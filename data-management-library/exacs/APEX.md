## Introduction


Oracle Application Express (Oracle APEX) is a rapid web application development tool for the Oracle database. Using only a web browser and limited programming experience, you can develop and deploy professional applications that are both fast and secure. Oracle APEX is a fully supported, no cost option of the Oracle database.

Why would you use Oracle APEX?

Oracle Application Express (APEX) is a low-code development platform that enables you to build scalable, secure enterprise apps, with world-class features, that can be deployed anywhere.

Low Code Development

With Oracle APEX and low code, your organization can be more agile - by developing solutions faster, for less cost, and with greater consistency. You can adapt to changing requirements with ease. Empower professional developers and everyone else in your organization to be a part of the solution.
