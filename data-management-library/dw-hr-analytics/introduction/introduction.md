## Introduction

**Departmental Data Warehouse - HR Analytics**

Lines of business like the Human Resources department, typically, don't have timely or efficient access to data and information. Analysts gather the data manually, work with it on an individual basis, and then share copies of files through email or file servers. With Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse and Oracle Analytics Cloud, you can load and optimize data from a multitude of sources into a centralized data warehouse for analysis so departments can gain actionable insights.

This solution uses data in an Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and then uses Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) to analyze the data to provide actionable insights.

This workshop will guide you through the installation of HR schema, available on the Oracle Autonomous Database. Thereafter, you will learn how to connect ADW to OAC and show a sample analysis with some refined data.

Estimated workshop time: 75 minutes

### Objectives
1. Provision the infrastructure required for HR analytics.
2. Analyze data using OAC.

### Prerequisites
- Access to a paid or a Livelabs Oracle Cloud account.
- Necessary permissions to be able to provision the stack in a compartment.
