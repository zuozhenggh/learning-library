# Introduction

In this workshop we will create a compute instance, download a script to configure streaming service, publish and consume messages. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Streaming service provides a fully managed, scalable, and durable storage solution for ingesting continuous, high-volume streams of data that you can consume and process in real time. Streaming can be used for messaging, ingesting high-volume data such as application logs, operational telemetry, web Click-stream data, or other use cases in which data is produced and processed continually and sequentially in a publish-subscribe messaging model.
