## Oracle Container Infrastructure Notifications Service

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Notifications service broadcasts messages to distributed components through a publish-subscribe pattern, delivering secure, highly reliable, low latency and durable messages for applications hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and externally. The Notifications service enables you to set up communication channels for publishing messages using topics and subscriptions . When a message is published to a topic, the Notifications service sends the message to all of the topic's subscriptions. In this lab we will verify notifications when a compute instance is launched and deleted
