### OCI Identity and Access Management Service

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM) Service lets you control who has access to your cloud resources. You control the types of access a group of users has and to which specific resources. The purpose of this lab is to give you an overview of the IAM Service components and an example scenario to help you understand how they work together.
