# Deployment

## Introduction
In this lab, you will Deploy the architecture on OCI via Resource Manager or the web console.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

## **STEP**: Deployment
Deploying this architecture on OCI can be done in different ways:

- The [Resource Manager](https://github.com/oci-hpc/oci-hpc-runbook-namd/blob/master/Documentation/ResourceManager.md#deployment-through-resource-manager) lets you deploy the infrastructure from the console. Only relevant variables are shown but others can be changed in the zip file.
- The [web console](https://github.com/oci-hpc/oci-hpc-runbook-namd/blob/master/Documentation/ManualDeployment.md#deployment-via-web-console) lets you create each piece of the architecture one by one from a webbrowser. This can be used to avoid any terraform scripting or using existing templates.
