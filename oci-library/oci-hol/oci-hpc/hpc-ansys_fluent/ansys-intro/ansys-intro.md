# ANSYS Fluent Introduction

## Introduction

Fluent software contains the broad, physical modeling capabilities needed to model flow, turbulence, heat transfer and reactions for industrial applications. These range from air flow over an aircraft wing to combustion in a furnace, from bubble columns to oil platforms, from blood flow to semiconductor manufacturing and from clean room design to wastewater treatment plants. Fluent spans an expansive range, including special models, with capabilities to model in-cylinder combustion, aero-acoustics, turbomachinery and multiphase systems. Ansys Fluent Website

This Runbook will take you through the process of deploying an ANSYS Fluent cluster on Oracle Cloud with low latency networking between the compute nodes. Running ANSYS Fluent on Oracle Cloud is quite straightforward, follow along this guide for all the tips and tricks.
