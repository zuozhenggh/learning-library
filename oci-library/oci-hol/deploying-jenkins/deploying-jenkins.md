# Deploying Jenkins

## Introduction

Faster software development has become a competitive advantage for companies. The automation of software development processes facilitates speed and consistency, which led to the rise for having a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery and Deployment (CD) pipelines. Jenkins is a very popular product among Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers, which can automate all of the phases of CI and CD. You can host Jenkins on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to centralize your build automation and scale your deployment as the needs of your software projects grow.
