![Oracle Analytics Cloud](./images/oac_banner.png)

## Introduction

This section describes the process of deploying **Oracle Analytics Cloud** instances on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen 2, which is the default for newly provisioned accounts in **EMEA** and **US**.

Your Oracle Cloud Free Tier account will use the Oracle Cloud Free Trial **credits** while this instance is provisioned, as Oracle Analytics Cloud is not part of the **Always Free** cloud services.

Provisioning an Oracle Analytics Cloud instance can take over **40 minutes**.

_Estimated workshop Time:_ 15 minutes.

### Objectives

1. Click on the menu icon on the right. Verify that you are signed in as a **Single Sign On** (Federated user) user by selecting the **Profile** icon in the top right hand side of your screen.  
    If your username is shown as:

    > oracleidentitycloudservice/&lt;your username&gt;
