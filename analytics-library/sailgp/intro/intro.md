# Introduction

![Oracle Workshop](images/banner.jpg)

SailGP is like Formula 1 on the water: the boats race over the water at speeds of up to 50 knots (60 m/h, 90 km/h).

SailGP offers the perfect playground for you to learn about analytics and Machine Learning. Why? It’s a data intensive sport; each boat has over 800 IoT sensors that provide more than 12,000 data points. To deliver game-changing insights from the data, SailGP employs “Data Athletes” who analyse all this data to help the teams make the best decisions on the water and stay ahead of the game.

On Sustainability, SailGP's innovative remote broadcast production saved 45 tons of CO2 in Taranto alone.

## About this Workshop

You have the chance to be a Data Athlete yourself! In this workshop, we will mix video from the races with theory on analytics and ML. Most importantly, we’ll be doing hands-on exercises where you’ll have the chance to practice what you’ve learned.

_Estimated Lab Time:_ 80 minutes

### Objectives
In this workshop, you will:

- Prepare data to make it ready for analysis
- Combine data to enrich it
- Visualize data in many ways, including geospatial representation
- Apply machine learning to predict outcomes

_At this point, you are ready to start learning! Please proceed._
